      "Go on. Father's watching. And your mother. Don't think too much, Bran. Don't look away. Father will know if you do. You did well. What is it? Now there are five. You want to hold it? Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them. I'm not a Stark. Get on. Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king? Uncle Benjen! Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst. So take me with you when you go back. Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will. I'm ready to swear your oath. I don't care about that. What're you doing back there? You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother? Lord Eddard Stark is my father. What the hell do you know about being a bastard? I already have one. Of course I have. We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years. Soon enough. It's good you've got help. Impressive. I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully. Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself. So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough. You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance? First lesson I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know. I came to say goodbye to Bran. I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid. You Starks are hard to kill. She was very kind. It was always my color. And you, Stark. Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care? Why do you read so much? Is this a trick? Until your brother killed that King. Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf. The Night's Watch protects the realm from... It's an improvement. Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same. They hate me because I'm better than they are. You're leaving? What kind of reports? m ready. I won't let you down. But I'm better than every... Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me. I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister. Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South? If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could. He'll never walk again. Farewell, My Lord. Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it. Enough! He yielded. Are you sure you want to do this? I've had worse. It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself. The Wall's no place for cowards. Come stand by the fire. It's warmer. You're not. You're freezing. You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam? Yes, he is. Well… You can't get any worse. Watch duty. With Sam. He wasn't hungry. That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him. No one touches Sam. I wouldn't doubt it. Sally on the side? I didn't think you'd be so upset about it. As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you. I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but... I know where to put it. Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros. Red. You don't want to know. Better. What's my name? And why is my surname Snow? I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child. I build my own fires. Why is he alone? There's no rider. That's my Uncle Benjen's horse. I do, my lord. Yes, my lord. Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath. Do you take me for a servant? May I go? I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger. Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say. We should burn them. Is there any word of my father? My sisters were in King's Landing too. Soon, he says. This is Valyrian steel. My lord, you honor me, but l can't – Yes, my lord. l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight. At what? What is it? You can't what? And yet you really want to say. You want to say that… What? What about him? l should be there. l should be with him. Sam said you wanted to see me? No. He would do whatever was right, no matter what. Sam told you. And this is my day? ls that what you're saying? You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother. Who are you? You're Aemon Targaryen. Get out of my way, Sam. Better than you do. l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. Move. Hyah! Ghost? l belong with my brother. They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back. l have to. I don't care about – To hell with all of you. My friends brought me back. They killed my father. No. Beyond the Wall? Having a rough time of it? What happens to the boys? He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons? We're not Southerners. Jon Snow. Lord commander. Your steward. What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons? What're you doing? Hello, Gilly. What're you doing? I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to - What? . No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible. Sam we can't take her - It's just not possible. If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why. Do what, ask her a question? Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand? No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that? We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You? I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her. Lord Commander- I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn. No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys... You know. Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster. I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child. When will he come? My uncle told me stories about him. I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall. So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own. I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts. Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand. A fire. Where? Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin. I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that? Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! He's not a pet. Ghost is different. I thought you said you couldn't know wild things. We could do the same. My father always said I'm of the North. I wasn't joking. I'll gladly give my life. I do. A girl. We could question her. What's your name? I'm Jon Snow. No. No, I'll do it. I'm as much a crow as they are. Can't. Someone might see the smoke. I'll find them. We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. There's no shelter anywhere. No fire. Yes. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. Stop it! You're still moving. Let's move. I'm a man of the Night's Watch. Don't call them that. Neither. Both. Move! There are no women of the Night's Watch, no. No. Never. We swore an oath. Would you please shut up? You're a free woman? If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"prisoner\" means. It was my choice to say the words. Of course I like girls. That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch. Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy! My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours. No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall. Walk. I know how to do it. We're close. Nothing happened between you and me. Turn back around. What, right here in the muck? That's enough. Enough! I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't- The others? They died because of me. They'll never trust me. What? I didn't. Careful with that. You might cut yourself. Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle. Stop! Mance was a ranger. When I'm free, will I be free to go? What happened to their fathers? My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts. Jon Snow. Your Grace. The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning. He wants me to lead one day. If I'm a traitor, then you are, too. I want to be free. We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw... I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place? Don't think too much, Bran. Relax your bow arm. Yes. I understand. You want to protect your people. No. What's wrong with him? It's only horses. No men. About three hundred. Do you think anyone got away? There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies. It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you. Three. Castle Black. Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower. A thousand. What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground? A thousand men. I don't need you to protect me. Give it back. Ygritte! Ygritte! Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte! Ygritte. We shouldn't. I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all. You seemed to like it. There's been no one else. Only you. I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid? Who was he? Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund- You ever climbed it before? Aren't you? You kill someone for them? Can we not talk about that here? Did I seem scared the other day? Only in the beginning. What secret? I won't. Take my hand! About a week, I think. When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad. Most of the time, yes. They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil. Usually it's the young boys banging the drums. They help the men march. Well, it's- it's the rhythm. No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming. I know you cut me loose on the Wall. And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird? You're gonna scare it off. It's too far away. It's a windmill. Just the men who used to live here. Winterfell has towers three times that size. If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell. Fainting. When a girl sees blood and collapses. Well not all girls are like you. I'd like to see you in a silk dress. So I could tear it off you. Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell. Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that. Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed. Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same. You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together. I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you. Yes, first we'll live. He breeds them for the Watch. The Watch protects him. We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat. The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers. Ygritte! You were right the whole time. Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am. I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me. I do know some things. I know I love you. I know you love me. But I have to go home now. Pyp? Sam? Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. \"He said, \" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could. He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance. I've done plenty wrong. I didn't murder him. He wanted me to kill him. The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army. Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him... Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl. I do. While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000. 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him. Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser? And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job. There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go? Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them. Help him. And the mutineers stayed? We need to ride north and kill them all. It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them. Bring it through! And again. Very nice. Good. A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds. Let's see what you can do. Olly, you just watch for now. Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet. You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other. You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him. Grenn and I were helping them. Someone has to train them. My father was highborn. My mother wasn't. Jon Snow. You fight well. She wasn't safe here. Castle Black could be next. We have orders. No one's to leave the castle. And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him. How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton? The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except... Thank you, Ser Alliser. Ahem, brothers. I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me? I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall. Thank you, brothers. How many? Why? Get some rest. We move at sundown. Are you all right? Come with me. Come on. We lost four brothers? I count ten dead mutineers. Where in seven hells? Come here. I missed you, boy. It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe. You want to stay here in Craster's Keep? Greetings. Come on, Ghost. Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon. We need to prepare. We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze. We wouldn't. Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have. They won't stop them. The stewards. No. The builders. You couldn't have known. We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want. If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close. She...she had red hair. Well what do you want me to say? So you and Gilly never- But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows? What? I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation. It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet! And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart. There will. Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch. There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser. Yes sir. It was a difficult decision either way, Ser. We can't just let them attack the gate! Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them? Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose! They won't summit before dawn. Because I've made that claim. Knock! Draw! Loose! Now! to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate. grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through... Oil! What are you doing up here? Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them. Two brothers now fight with me. to Sam* I don't want you out there. I need him more than I need you. No, shh, don't talk. We'll go back there. Tormund. It's over, let it end. Put him in chains. We'll question him later. Aye, you shouldo ve. For one night. Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them. I'm going to find Mance. Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home. I'm going to try. He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too. You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan? They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out. I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back. I've been sent to negotiate with you. The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows. She put three arrows in me when I escaped. Yes. She's dead. No. Ygritte. That's not wine. He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn. Grenn came from a farm. Grenn and Mag. Turn your army around and go home. I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men. No, it's like you said, we don't have the men. I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall. I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son. He was, your grace. I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say. Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them. He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe. No one's going to torture you. I don't know what happens to the prisoners. I suppose Stannis does. I don't have a king. We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them? Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it. Say farewell. She told you? Get your shield up. If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up. Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell. Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up! You're not cold, my lady? No. Roose Bolton. I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now. They're good men. It's where she belonged. They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters. The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part-- Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army? I don't think that's likely. I respect him. Your grace… How much time do I have? Here we are. This doesn't have to be our last meeting. You know what Stannis wants? Shouldn't a king be bold? You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough. You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? Then bend the knee and save your people. And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid. They'll burn you alive. And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing. I think you're making a terrible mistake. With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive. No. Only one of their own. The Lord Commander's niece. Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark. I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own. Most likely. Unpleasant, I expect. I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you. I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow. It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again. I'm going to refuse him. I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be? Your Grace. Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command. I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here. I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch. I can imagine no higher praise. May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black? You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming. And the wildlings? Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. . I heard it was best to keep your enemies close. I'm sorry I disappointed him. As long as he's ruling them. I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. And what needs to be done? Sam. . Maester Aemon? Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger. Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger. Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard. Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his - You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard. Are you refusing to obey my order? Take Lord Janos outside. Olly, bring me my sword. If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time. Good. Never even heard of these people. And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us? Not him. He murdered my brother. How can I help you? Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions. I don't think Stannis would like that very much. I can't. I swore a vow. . I loved another. I know. But I still love her. Maester Aemon. Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone. How are you feeling? I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order. But you don't know what it is. Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them? What about you? What if I unchained you? Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours. For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you. It is. Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall. I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes. And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward. Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people. Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week. I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet. Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing. And we've slaughtered theirs. You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that. Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right. It's not a trick. I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone. No. You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you. First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black. As always, thank you for your honesty. Thank you, Sam. Me too. Does that make me a fool? He's not my prisoner. We're allies. We're not here to fight. We're here to talk. My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there. In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them. It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us. Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker. No. But I trust the man. Come with me and I'll share these weapons. There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands. I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life. If you swear you join us when the real war begins. He died. I put an arrow through his heart. I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight. How many are with us? 5000? We're leaving too many behind. And he knew them better than I ever will. Get in line! Get in line! Hold the line! Hold the line! Get them to the ship and come back for me! Now! You should be on one of those boats. You have my word. I've given orders. Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move! The Dragonglass! Go! Go! Go! Let's go now! Now! It was a failure. I went to save them, I failed. I don't think that fact's lost on them. Here's a silver because the lady likes you. He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world. I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall. No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it. With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw… Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? Here's to us then. Long may they sneer. What? I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust? You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too. Sam? Sam… You've just been beaten half to death. How did you-- I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone. To your return. We don't have enough men to make any difference. The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before-- It's not their fight! Stannis? Are you sure he's talking about Benjen? He could be lying. Where is he? Olly… They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here Nothing There was nothing at all I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why? I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed I'm not a god I think so Hold off on burning my body for now If you have any last words, now is the time Neither was killing me I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser You should Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black My watch is ended South Get warm I did everything I could You know that Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life They killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that? With the peas and onions? We never should have left Winterfell How could we know? We were children You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played There's nothing to forgive All right All right, I forgive you You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me I can't stay here, not after what happened Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave? I don't have an army They didn't come here to serve me Sansa I'm tired of fighting It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost I'm not Lord Commander anymore. SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading. To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. SNOW looks at SANSA. His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You -- It's just more of the same. SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading. Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. We don't know that. How many do you have? SNOW nods. We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men. There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build. How do you know that? New dress? Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit. Thank you, Sansa. Don't knock it down while I'm gone. That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive. Are you sure they'll come? Lady Mormont. I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- - Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- - Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance. Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- - Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost. Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect? 62? Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- - House Mormont. We sent raven to Houses Manderly- - The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings. Lord Glover. We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day.. We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can. Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years. There's no time. We fight with the army we have. You don't have to be here. You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me. Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them? If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out. It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning... We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment. A pincer move. They won't be able to hit us from the sides. No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt. Aye, for what they're worth. You're right. He's overconfident. Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton. All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back? We can't give up on our brother. Of course he does. What should I do differently? Aye, that's good advice. Well, it is a bit obvious. When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men! Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds. SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise. My lady. You weren't at the war council. Any advice? If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back. I'm ordering you not to bring me back. You're in my camp. I'm the commander. How do you know what he commands? Why? What kind of god would do something like that? Get word -- We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father. When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there. Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most. What is that? Do you have anything to say for yourself? Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer. I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you. I'm not a Stark. You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons. And you trust him? We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. Well, Father always promised, didn't he? The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield. The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm. There's nothing to forgive, my lord. I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow. Not just the boys. We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting. While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk. But if we're going to survive this winter together... Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold. The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation. I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons. The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle. When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, \"The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,\" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final. Ned Umber. Alys Karstark. For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon. Stand. Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always? You are my sister, but I am king now. When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me. Of course you can, but-- Do you think I'm Joffrey? Thank you. At what? No. What did father used to say? Everything before the word \"but\" is horse shit. No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls. All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me. And how should I be smarter? By listening to you? Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms-- Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors. I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too. There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north. You almost sound as if you admire her. Read the last bit. It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think? What? But? Come in. This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass. I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister. He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons. Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept. We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons. But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone. I know that. It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man. You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it. Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me. I'm leaving both in good hands. Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours. You don't belong down here. I have nothing to say to you. Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself. The dwarf of Casterly Rock. You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road. Of course. She is. I didn't ask -- She's starting to let on. As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen. My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here. True. But I'm not a Stark. The winds were kind, Your Grace. I am not. Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms. You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows. Because I need your help and you need mine. I did. They're hard to miss. But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei. Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair. Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north. I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy. The Army of the Dead is on the march. You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman? The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves -- we're finished. You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King. There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating -- And why would I do that? I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can. Am I your prisoner? I'm a prisoner on this island. Except to my ship. They took my ship. I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all. It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King -- You probably don't believe me. You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense. How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all? I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer. I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave. Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool. What do you mean? Amazing thing to see. You've been talking to Tyrion? He enjoys talking. I don't. I never expected that you would. I haven't either. Thank you. So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead? Your Grace. I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits. leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave. So this is it, all we'll ever need. There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace. and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass. The Children of the Forest made these. A very long time ago. No. They were here together the Children and the First Men. takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers. and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King. Because the enemy is real. It's always been real. No, I don't think I can. My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered. and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion. I would never presume to -- looks over the ocean at the dragons flying. I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known. glances back towards the dragons. But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same. and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion. Who? I think she has a good heart. There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less? What? It doesn't matter. Of course. I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married. Why did you leave your homeland? I'm sorry. And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow -- You believe that? notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look. Is that a Greyjoy ship? grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face. What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you. releases THEON. The queen is gone. SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away. That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts. You weren't gone long. And? pauses and doesn't say anything. No, I'm not. Thousands. Ser Davos gets carried away. doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue. I served with your father. He was a great man. I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead. Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall -- interrupts VARYS. I need to go home. We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us. I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation. The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall. pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence. The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone. They won't have to. I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them. With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance. stops and turns around to face DAVOS. You survived King's Landing. Your Grace, this is -- looks to DAVOS. I saw your father once at Winterfell. You're a lot leaner. stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles. I grew up on stories about them. Do you know how to use one? Well, that's a problem. nods. We could use the help. If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace. Heave! and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle. Two. Both. looks around the table. Not enough. smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed. You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell. He's right. We're all on the same side. We're all breathing. Are you all right? Ever been north before? You've never been down south. That's the north. There's not another woman within 100 miles of here. glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND. Davos says he is a strong fighter. She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee. The first time I went north of the wall was with your father. I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice. I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block. I heard. I'm glad he didn't capture you. stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword. Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw. hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands. Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it. I'm not his son. Who's that? You knew him? I serve the north. The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me. Why? That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants. So what are you fighting for? But we all die. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. Aye. Maybe that's enough. How many people live here? That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way? This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead. This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't. We can destroy them by burning them. And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world. There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here. No. I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. I know! I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father. I did this. I should go. No one is less happy about this than I am. You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here. Who told you that? Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information? So, what now? It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked. If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight. It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message. All right. We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together. It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret. No. Not compared to you. Our father was more of a father. And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory. But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me. It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark. So, why are you still talking to me? I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders. Look at you. You're a man. Where's Arya? Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell. We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here. It's not important. You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North. How did you sneak up on me? I didn't. You still have it. Have you ever used it? Jealous? Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa. Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone. Now you're defending her? You? Yeah. I'm her family too. She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up. What's the matter? What's wrong with them? I don't know how to ride a dragon. What if he doesn't want me to? What do I hold onto? You've completely ruined horses for me. We'd be pretty old. It's cold up here for a southern girl. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.\" Isn't that what he said? I told you we needed allies. I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons. Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance. Do you have any faith in me at all? She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father. Sam? Were you hiding from me? What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already? What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right? Little Sam? Know what? I'm so sorry. We need to end this war. Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me. I wasn't a king. I gave up my crown, Sam. I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore. What are you talking about? My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life. Daenerys is our queen. That's treason. We need every man we can get. I thought we'd lost you. How did you find each other? The Umbers? How long do we have? They're coming. We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel. But there are too many of them. Far too many. Our enemy doesn't tire. Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel. We can't beat them in a straight fight. The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance. We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest. If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does. Let's get some rest. Your Grace. No. Gilly? Little Sam? If you want to join them. To protect them. Now it's just us three. Lyanna Stark. He didn't. He loved her. They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard. My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen. I wish it were. Bran. He saw it. And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant. It's true, Dany. I know it is. The Night King is coming. Dany! Get off! Bran! We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again. Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she? She shouldn't be alone. Aren't you worried for her? We're not much for riddles where I'm from. That's her decision to make. She is our queen. What do you want? I don't want it. I never have. She is my queen. I don't want it, and that's what I told him. I love you. And you will always be my queen. Daybreak at the earliest. Move, move! No! Get back! Get back! Stay! Stay! Stop! Find somewhere to hide. We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back! Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! It's not safe. Let me send some men with you. Grey Worm! It's over. And what are the queen's commands? What are you doing here? Hey, what happened? She's everyone's queen now. Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you. No. Not that I've seen. You didn't. I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now. And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today. You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister. Cersei left her no choice. She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky. Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield. What? I don't know. What's it matter what I'd do? Love is the death of duty. Maester Aemon said it a long time ago. That's her decision. She is the queen. I'm sorry it came to this. My sisters will be loyal to the throne. She doesn't get to choose. I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders. Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned! And Tyrion? Forgive him. You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand. Please, Dany. The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be. How do you know? How do you know it'll be good? I don't. What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good. You are my queen. Now, and always. There's still a Night's Watch? Was it right? What I did? It doesn't feel right. I don't expect we'll ever see each other again. The North is free, thanks to you. Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for. You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black. You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed? You have your Needle? Your Grace. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me. \n"

      "We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything. No. I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home. I don't know. Thank you, ser. Are you from my country? Thank you, Magister. She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki. Do you know the Common Tongue? Is ‘no' the only word that you know? Isn't there anything else? Have you ever seen a dragon? Everywhere? Even in the east? The moon? Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories? How old were you? Nine?! Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy? Will it take three years? Finish a man? Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top. I don't think that this is the Dothraki way. No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face. From whom? Tell them all to stop. Until I command them otherwise. Not a Queen. A Khaleesi. No! Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed. What are you doing? It's a boy. I know. These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages. If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms? But if they did? And you know these men? You sold slaves. Why? And where is she now? Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us. Why did you hit her?! I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper. It's a gift. I had it made for you. Please. Stop - stop it. You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet. I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands. I hit him. I hit the dragon. He is still the true King. No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return. What do you pray for, Ser Jorah? I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home. You're hurt. A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego! Stop him. Viserys, please. He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold. No. He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon. According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world. The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea. Lands, yes... It's not a chair. It's a... A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen. Can't you help me make him understand? My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. And because he had dragons. You don't believe it. My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine. Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine. You honor me, Ser. I hope to repay your kindness someday. Is something wrong? Do as he says. You will drink. I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone. He will not have my son. My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo. He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here. We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me. Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me. Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is. He can't. He can't. l won't let him. l won't leave him. Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo. Stop it! l don't want her hurt. l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon. l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser. And now you must save him. Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic. Do it. Save him. You'll have gold, whatever you want. My death? Kill her and you kill your khal. l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden. Take her and leave. Take her! No one will enter. Bring him back to me. l have to save him. This must be. No, you can't. The baby – is coming. Ser Jorah? My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he? Tell me. How did my son die? What do the women say? Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life. l want to see him now. The khalasar is gone. Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone? This is not life. When will he be as he was? Leave us. l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go. You knew what l was buying and you knew the price. This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent. l spoke for you. l saved you. Your life. Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars. They were not given to me to sell. l must. You don't understand. ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives. Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me. I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life. He said they ate meat. My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything. She was Drogo's first gift to me. I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream? Does it ever end? And you're sure there's no other way? No one will take my dragons. As you are mine. Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast. Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood. You never have. Does it ever end? Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. He is blood of my blood. Who did this? They will like it far less when I'm done with them. Shh. They cannot kill his soul. Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre. And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight. This isn't your horse. Qarth? Will they let us in? What do you know of this place? I thought we were welcome. Horde? My name is Daenerys- You know me, my lord? And what should I call you? The beauty of Quarth is legendary- Qarth. My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored I am not a liar. Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates. What are you doing? You promised to receive me. If you do not let us in, all of us will die. Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first. Dracarys. Dracarys. He'll be able to feed himself from now on. Let him sleep, Doreah. He loves you. Thank you, my friend. The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo. Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy. It sounds wonderful. Please excuse me for a moment. What are they doing? We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it. Not even when we leave. Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more. My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built. That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be. What is the House of the Undying? He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend. And what about what a woman wants? To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne. Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home. I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it. And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you? So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious. What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why? And behind the door? And it can all be mine? All I have to do? That was a romantic proposal. The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country. The usurper is dead. The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other. The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world. And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now. Do not speak to me like I'm a child. What do you want? Tell me. Why? So what would you have me do, as my advisor? And how do I get the ship? I look forward to meeting him. He shouldn't make me wait. I already have a husband. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. My father sat there, before he was murdered. I didn't come here to argue grammar. Not yet. There are many there that support my claim. I left when I was a baby. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? Where are they? Where are my dragons? You are one of the Thirteen. Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world. There is no we, so why would you help me get them back? But it did happen under your roof. I don't care where you've been. You came back. Irri is dead. She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her. We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse. You went to find me a ship. These people\"? And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse. The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive. And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool. There it is. \"Trust me. \" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it. And you are too familiar. Find my dragons. Please, they're my children. I'm begging you. Without me, the dragons will die. How? You have my dragons? But there is no King of Qarth. Astapor? They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children. You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there. Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there. And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember? They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them. Let them try. Is this a riddle? Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl? This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands. That sounds like something you would do. Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me. Dracarys. Come. Nothing. Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson. Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship? Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people. It's too beautiful a day to argue. Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ... They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training. Tell the good master there is no need. You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? How many do you have to sell? Eight thousand dead babies. Once I own them, these men... Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? The warlocks. I owe you my life, Ser. You know this man? To whom? Give me your water. Here, drink. The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents. Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon. They did not. I want to buy them all. Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well. I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop. I have dragons. I'll give you one. One. Done. I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck. You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood? Do you have a name? Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice? You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth. I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.' Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed. Yes, all men must die. But we are not men. Is it done, then? They belong to me? Unsullied! Forward march! Halt! A dragon is not a slave. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue. Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see! Dracarys. Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men? These are the ones? You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks? Remove your helmet What is your name? Grey Worm. From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride. I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea. How many slaves are there in Yunkai? Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city. Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor. You may approach. Sit. Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early. My ship? And what do you ask in return? I have a gift for you as well. Your life. And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy. I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother. My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out. And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? Find out. You know these men? Is he more titan or bastard? How many? Enough to make a difference? It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning. He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl. We have no slaves here. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? We have more, don't we? I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. You're very young to be a captain. Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side. Or you could fight for me. I would pay you as much and more. Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder. A barrel, then. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Ninteen How can anyone speak nineteen languages? Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well? Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride. Athjahaka. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice. What do you want? Let her go. You were sent here to kill me? So why haven't you? What do your captains have to say about that? Why? Over what? You're a strange man. And this is supposed to impress me? Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? Will you fight for me? Swear to me. Where? Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa. You leave tonight. We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city? And Daario Naharis? Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered. People learn to love their chains. No. You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you. What does it mean? It's all right. These people won't hurt me. Fly. Let me pass Ser Barristan. Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm? Gambling? How long have they been at it? What's the prize to winning this stupid contest? That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock. The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for. Have you ever been to Meereen? And? And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried? You were told to ride at the back of the train. All right, what is this matter of strategy? Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding? Would you like to walk without shoes? You are a gambler, aren't you? How many miles are there between here and Meereen? You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her. Are they attacking? What is he doing? I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion? You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you. Which is why you must remain by my side. You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life. Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while. Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching. You sure you don't want a horse? Horses are faster than men. I am Daenerys Stormborn. Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you. Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward! Fire! How are the lessons coming? You'll have to continue later. It's time. Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts? Yes, that was it. I will answer injustice with justice. Who told you to take the Navy? So why did you do it? How many ships? How many men can they carry? Would that be enough to take King's Landing? Please leave me. Not you, Jorah. It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned. You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well. How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me? I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros. I will do what queens do. I will rule. You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend. I thank him for his prayers. Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats, but I will see he is paid their value three times over. Send the next one in. The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself. I thank you. Then it is my honor to receive you. For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him. Your father crucified innocent children. I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that. And what traditions do you speak of? And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial? Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq. How many more? 212? How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded, Don't do that again. These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you. Tell me why you're here. I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing. And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue. You swore me your sword. So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets? Very well. Do what you do best. Take off your clothes. You're here early. You don't approve? You neither approve nor trust. Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother? I trust you. I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai. I have. That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself. And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning? Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it. And now you are helping me show them to freedom. The man who came to me the other day about burying his father. He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one. Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind. No. Tell him you changed my mind. You think he was spying on you? The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see. But you are not Dothraki. Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes. What? When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it? The...the pillar an the stones. Haven't you ever wondered? Why did the usurper pardon you? No, speak to me here. Explain it to me. The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged. Why, then? What was the content of these letters? What information? You told him I was carrying Drogo's child? Yes or no? Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child? That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information. Because you knew it was poisoned. You betrayed me from the first. You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne... and you want me to forgive you? Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can. Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now. You speak it very well. I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you? I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them. My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you. What is it that you want from me? You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair? I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year. Approach my friend. What was her name? How old was she? Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon? in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs. Sons of the Harpy? They've never killed before. I didn't conquer them. Their own people did. Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost? I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces. Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me. Good. Concessions? I'm not a politician. I'm a queen. I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery. The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death? No fighting pits. I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting. How many times must I say no before you understand? Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits… What? Why? You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits? That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets. I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore. Viserion? Rhaegal? Easy. Easy. Easy. It would send a message. Why? Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was. Thank you all for your counsel. About what? The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded. Go on. I'm not my father. I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial. He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right. There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters. The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law-- The law is the law. Take him. You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other. A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death. Leave me. Drogon... Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What? Why? He sang to them? And what did you do? He was good? He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. . And what did you do with the money? How many others are there? Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan? I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me. Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport? I do not recognize this tradition. Barristan the Bold\" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks. I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me. Walk forward. Another step. They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must. But she does not give up on them. Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide. Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps. If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think? You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think? What about \"Valar Morghulis\"? It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live. And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees. Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that. Are you jealous? I do. You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice. So what else can I do? Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't. No. I can't Of course I am a queen. Not a butcher. Sitting through the great games will be bad enough. I think I've seen enough. I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions. Get him out of my sight. Who are you? You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are? If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family? If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word. And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you? I have a very large army and very large dragons. So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned. Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises? Yes, many opportunities. No. Not until forced to do so. So I should kill him? Remove Ser Jorah from the city. So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service? It's probably my safest option. And what would your father do? Is that why you killed him? I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name. I'm terrible? Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible? Which kind is that? I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment. Perhaps it won't come to that. Varys? King Robert's spy master? Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me. But you trust him? The brother who killed my father. Perhaps I will have you killed after all. I'm not going to kill you. No. You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences. How to get what I want. If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool. I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home. The common people. Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground. I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel. Where have you been? I'm not putting my money anywhere. Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you? That is greatness? One day your great city will return to the dirt as well. If need be. If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason. Someone else's reason. Drogon! Valahd.. We have to go home. My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen? How far did you carry me? Drogon, we need to return. My people need me. Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper. Do not touch me I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons I will not lie with you And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east. I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo I know I burnt his body If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads! You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen That is more than most have I need to make water I will never run from Dothraki I needed fresh air The old women stink You must have been very young when your Khal died Too bad he didn't die sooner Mm-hmm They do Would you like to see them one day? No, don't hurt her We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive No We can do more than that And you're going to help me And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads. Don't you want to know what I think? No. I don't want either of those things. I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World. This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains. And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will. lays her hand on a fire pit. You're not going to serve. You're going to die. knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows. I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away. Is there a cure? How long does it take? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal. You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life. Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side. How many days' ride to Meereen? How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros? And who has that many? Nobody yet. I take what is mine. What was I made for? Wait here. Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all. I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea? Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses? Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains? Are you with me? Now and always? The city is on the rise? Good. Shall we begin? I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan. You don't approve? This is entirely different. We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine. My reign has just begun. Dracarys. You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands? And what's wrong with you? Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before? Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king. We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough? So why shouldn't I wait for him? And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands? And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms? And that's all? Reasonable. She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it. You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping. No more. You're not coming with us. You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders. You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage. I don't know. Maybe no one. I can't bring a lover to Westeros. So that's what you want? To be my mistress? I can't. No one tells me to do anything. Don't get angry. A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons. We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we? Farewell, Daario Naharis. No tears. It's not. Yes, you really are. Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it. Well, you have completely failed to console me. It's your counsel I need. Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right. Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen. Shall we begin? I wish I could remember it. I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home. Good. Not so many lions. They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health? People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them. If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already. No. I never properly thanked you for that. You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys? And then you served the man who overthrew him? But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him. So you took it upon yourself to find a better one. Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion? So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki. Who gave the order to kill me? Who hired the assassins? Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen? To keep yourself alive. Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that? Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them. And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive. The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name? You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone. We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king. The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he? What does your Lord expect from me? The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince. No, but I like it better. And you believe this prophecy refers to me? You know him? He sounds like quite a man. Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee. That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect. I am not here to be queen of the ashes. I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing. We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people. Do I have your support? Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone? I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros. Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough. Forgive me -- Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong? No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion? Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee. Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen? My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it. Then why are you here? Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived? And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me? But still, I need your help? Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help. You told me you liked this man. In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child. As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north. The dead? Is that another figure of speech? I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it. We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea. They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will. That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion. You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms. Not yet. And? All of them? Dragonglass? Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies. And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass? And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings? Which wise man said this? Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom? What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that? I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now. You lost two brothers as well? People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know. He is my Hand. We all enjoy what we're good at. You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne. And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne. I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you. You better get to work, Jon Snow. We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it. I'm not talking about sending our ships after him. I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them? What about Casterly Rock? and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard. Soon. They will come back to me. stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking. What happened? Many things? looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down. It's all right. descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch. is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass. When? They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men. stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together. Doing what? Fighting each other? They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive. turns to look at JON. And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons? steps forward closer to JON. I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee. steps even closer to JON until they're face to face. They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? What is it? That's very good to hear. Isn't it? You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island. Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach. stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion. The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach. Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all. begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water. Enough with the clever plans. turns back and looks at TYRION. I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep. My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them? looks over to JON SNOW. What do you think I should do? I'm at war. I'm losing. begins walking close to JON. looks back out to her dragons flying along the water. Dracarys! commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow. I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities -- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die. Step forward, My Lord. You will not kneel? You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that. turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward. Who are you? I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it. I'm not beheading anyone. looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm. Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die. pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON. Dracarys. They're beautiful, aren't they? They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children. turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance. turns back to JON. No. And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday. You're not sure how you feel about that? turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows. How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons? We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people. So it was a figure of speech? He is my friend. Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend. You look strong. You found a cure? It would be my honor. steps forward and hugs JORAH. and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it. I'm happy for you. You don't look happy. You said you don't have enough men. And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in. I thought that was what we are trying to avoid. And how would you get into King's Landing. Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men. turns to look at JORAH. I haven't given you permission to leave. pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement. We should be better at saying farewell by now. reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS. smiles. But I've grown used to him. nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it. Do you know what I like about you? You're not a hero. walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION. I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing. Jon Snow's not in love with me. My apologies. Yes. That's all. Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word. I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all. A hundred thousand, at least. Just the King I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing. I didn't come all this way to have my Hand I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it. This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else. I can't have children. The witch who murdered my husband. You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different. I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north. And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell. I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together. Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you. Whatever they want. Your sister doesn't like me. She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me- How many today? The dragons are barely eating. They don't like the North. Go on. Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon. Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow. Whatever you can. We could stay a thousand years- No one would find us. So keep your queen warm. Don't be afraid. So you're the man? The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could. I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward. Well, there must be something I could give you. For what crime? From the Citadel? Not Randyll Tarly? I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused. Your brother stood with your father. Of course. When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father. Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor. He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp. Your sister pledged to send her army north. I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me. We\"? Like you knew your sister? Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat. So why have you abandoned your house and family now? What does the Warden of the North say about it? Very well. Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool. Not for the first time. Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can. Have you done something to offend me? Long ago and long forgiven. When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much. He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes. You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position? Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone. I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime. I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors. I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good. I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei. I thought he knew his sister. Ours certainly have been. We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell. And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother. That bothers you. All my life, I've known one goal I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about. Someone taller. I take the Iron Throne. What is it? Your sister? But why aren't you with her? Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt. There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it. Who's that? My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her. That's impossible. Who told you this? He saw it? A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you? If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne. The dead are already here. Dracarys. Go! Jorah! Gendry. That's right, isn't it? You're Robert Baratheon's son. You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered? Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now? Does anyone? I think you should be Lord of Storm's End. No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you. See? You're not the only one who's clever. Someone has betrayed me. Jon Snow. He knows the truth about Jon. Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me. And Varys? You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission. Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain? Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down. No. It doesn't matter now. Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ... sentence you to die. Dracarys. This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession. It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him. What did I say would happen if you told your sister? She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear. Is that all I am to you? Your queen? All right, then. Let it be fear. In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived. They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine? Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness. But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant. Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies. Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time. Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines. It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me. Blood of my blood. You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits. Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms. Torgo Nudho. You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War. Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant! But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world! From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel. Will you break the wheel with me? You freed your brother. You committed treason. Take him. When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet. It was necessary. I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me. He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart? I can't. We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have. And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world. Because I know what is good. And so do you. You do. You do. You've always known. They don't get to choose. Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together. \n"

      "And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid. What if Jon Arryn told someone? My husband. You should be the Hand of the king. We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait. Where is our brother? Go find the little beast. Yes. Lovely country. Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you? You're tall. Still growing? And have you bled yet? And your dress. Did you make it? Such talent. You must make something for me. I hear we might share a grandchild someday. Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever. Stop. STOP. He saw us. He saw us! What do you mean? It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain. I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you. The children don't need to hear your filth. Come. Please. This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now. It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you. Perhaps this time she'll listen. How dare you speak to your King in that manner? Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off. Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him. She's not. Sansa, come here, darling. She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished. Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life. And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son? We have another wolf. Where is the beast? Ser Ilyn, do me the honor. Is this some trick? Please, it's nearly healed. A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father. That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it. Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl. No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road. How would you handle them? A royal army? And if the northerners rebel? And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord? But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers. The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies. Everyone who isn't us is an enemy. How could you be so stupid? He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking? Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing. What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw... And my husband? Let me go. And if you find the proof? You're missing your tournament. I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa? The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her. I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish? You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces. You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow. As was I. I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together. Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces. No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way? The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons. Is my father wrong? We still outnumber them. Five. What do you want? Our marriage. Every day. Well, seventeen years is quite a long time. Yes, it tis. What was she like? At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it. What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over? I felt something for you once, you know? Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment? It doesn't make me feel anything. Do you know what your wife has done? By what right dare you lay hands on my blood? You were the King's Hand! You shall now be held accountable. Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime. I took you for a king. He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown. I shall wear this like a badge of honor. You're in pain. Perhaps it's time to go home. Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles? Jaime would have killed him. My brother is worth a thousand of your friend. The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure. Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together. Do you love your children? No more than I love mine. Thank the Gods. Hated him? I worshiped him. And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself. Oh, but it was. Robert, my sweet... You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark. You think he stands alone? Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest. Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt. You disappoint me, child. That depends. On your brother. And on you. Ser Barristan Selmy. Rise, Ser Barristan. Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's? The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Careful, Ser. Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa? My son, this is madness. Stop talking. Get back into bed. You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt? And are you not a Lord at my command? Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? This is the small council. Our father is Hand of the King. Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this. I've done nothing. I tried to stop it. Robb Stark is a child. What do you know about warfare? Joffrey is King. You are here to advise him. How? One. Arya, little animal, she disappeared. Lord Baelish. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her. And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her. If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts. A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you? Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing. I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another. And which truth is that? Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it. What is all this? We can't find Arya Stark. Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone. We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather - His life is in danger. Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne. Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip - What are you asking? What are you doing here? I've done nothing. What are you asking? From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that. You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest? If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten. If that's everything? Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count. Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare. One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. . I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all. Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him. You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent. Ha, the people. You think I care? He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep. I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me. You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death. Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. . Soon, darling, when the war is over. The princess just spoke to you. He might. Would you like that? Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove? You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore? I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon. Are you mad? The Martells loathe us. She'll be a hostage. You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too. No. No! Get out! Get out! Killed? By whom? Really? Who'd have thought? Whomever did it, I say well done. Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one. Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away? Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety. So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots? No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations. You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same. It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you. Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more. In what way? Wait until you birth a child. You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means? A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen. Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood. Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion. You may never love the king, but you will love his children. That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice. You can try, little dove. Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant. How many times can you read one raven scroll? More than we have. We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above. Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he? I'm sure you'll make a point eventually. I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse. Did you? Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me. I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light. Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins. The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? \"Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.\" Odd little boy. You and Varys both. He's only a boy. He's not ready. Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield. Do you think I'm an idiot? You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die. Do you know why Varys is so dangerous? Because he doesn't have a cock. Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking. Because I'm happy. Because I have your little whore. Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased. Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed. For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time. Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully. Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me. You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt. Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore. Get out. Your words are always wise and measured. You brought me something? I know what ten drops will bring. You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon. Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many. Sansa. I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming? Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine. So? I didn't offer you water. Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him. Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors. The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning. The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen. He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine. Sansa, come here, little dove. What are you doing? You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for? Oh. On all of us? Even me? Even Joffrey? Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four. He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much. One for her. Here. Sit. Drink. Not like that. Drink, girl. I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens. It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits. You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse. Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink. Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten. When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired. And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one. Pretty. That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend. Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service? When did you leave Lorath? I had a Lorathi handmaiden once. But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros? From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name? Tell us a story, Shae. What news? Where is Joffrey? Bring him back inside at once. What? Bring him back to his chambers now. With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life? Now! When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive. Where is my son? Why do I care what you want? Bring me- Shh! Be calm, my sweet. No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods. Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things. Like stags. And wolves. He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, \"You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid.\" For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head. And the cub said, \"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?\" Yes,\" said his mother. \"You will be strong and fierce just like your father. I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you. Father. Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside. It's your sister. The queen. Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in? If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me? I'm not afraid of you, little brother. I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that. I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father. No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room. You're meeting Father today? Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him? You're going to make me cry. Because you've slandered me to Father before. You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock. I was nine, too. If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again. And what's this truth you plan on telling him today? Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey. You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are. Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold. You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning. An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life. You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery. I'm sure she does. That's better. It makes you look very strong. Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric. Tell me what you think of her. Margaery. It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent. Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting. I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself. Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason. You need to ask yourself I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge. Lord Baelish. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart. My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts. And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital. Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark? Yes, it is. She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length. You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve. What do you mean? I will not. No, I won't do it. I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare. Father, don't make me do it again, please. We can have them both killed. Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together. The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family. I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate. What do you want me to say? Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here. Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands. When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere. Who's going to tell her? Radiant? Why radiant? You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice. Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'? So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.' If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep. Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead. Stay. Nobody cares what your father once told you. A joke. Joffrey did not mean it. Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man. Come along. We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest. Come. Leave. So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend. Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world. I won't be marrying Ser Loras. You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child. So she can have some happiness in her life. Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive. Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own. Until we've dealt with all our enemies. Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time. Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right. Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel? Elegant, I think. Thank you for your help with the other matter. Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn. I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know? Symptoms that are not your concern. You jealous? You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat. Well, they smell like Pycelle. Yes. Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident. My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege. A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So... He can't disown you. You're all he's got. You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you? Not now. Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same? For leaving me. Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone. You took too long. I'm saying you took too long. Come in. She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one. He saw us. You're an example to us all. Did you just bow? Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not. I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing. Did he? Haven't heard that story before. I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy. But you love him. She'll do no such thing. You should see Qyburn. He's quite good. More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs? My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me? But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels. The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will. I suppose I am. Small pleasures. Can't say I've ever met a Sand before. No? How tolerant of you. I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding. Help him! Someone help him! Joffrey! Joffrey! Joffrey! Don't touch him! Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him! My son. He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him! You did this. You did this! Take him! Take him! Where is his wife? Where's Sansa? Where is she?! This is hardly the place or the time. It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. \"A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.\" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he... Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion. I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy. Jaime, not here, please. Please. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. It's not right. It's not right. It's not right. Don't. Don't. Jaime, don't. Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door? So one? You have one man guarding the future king? The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free? I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free? She hoped or did you promise? So you made a sacred vow to the enemy. You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark? I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son. And? You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander. There he is. Long may he reign. Yes. He wasn't, though, was he? You still mourn for Joffrey? He would have been your nightmare. You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked? The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it. He will need help... if he's going to rule well. A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it? Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine. As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband. That seems reasonable. Shortly after Tommen's. A fortnight. We had that in common. Then whom can we trust? Robert wasn't particularly rich. I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one. Haven't a clue. Pounds, tons, ounces? That can't be. Then how do we pay for anything? How much? There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement. Someone does work there. It is comprised of people. It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do. I respect that. We don't need to discuss it. The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire? Prince Oberyn. Writing letters? May I show you the gardens? No, you couldn't. I didn't realize you were a poet. For your paramour? You have several, don't you? Eight? Eight daughters? Beautiful name. Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they? You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love? Yes, we can avenge them. I know he did. We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year. I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy. Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again. The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water. Please tell her... her mother misses her very much. A coward and a traitor. Conquered with what? Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace. He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son. Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world. I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid. Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops. I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased. Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly. You seem to be in good form. Does it matter? Bloody Martells. You're dismissed, Grand Maester. Not anymore. You can save him? Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need. Will it weaken him? Very well then. I'm opening it again. I will not. I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king. I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times. When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away. Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen. I'll tell everyone the truth. You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known. Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me. Your legacy is a lie. Yes you do. Jaime. For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine. He's not. I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world- A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose? I choose you. Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him. I told him about us. I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you. Go and ask him. I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters. I don't care. Why not? He'll never know we've been gone. You don't need to be afraid of my father. Yes. Of course we should. No. They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring. I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine. This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head. I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry? But I will be queen? Will the king and I have children? That doesn't make sense. They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him. They will wait. He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body. They? They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years… and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free? Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world. Thank you so much for your kind words. Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you. Uncle, it's quite alright. I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me. Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed. What can I do for you? What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness? I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere. I don't know what you're talking about. The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help… There are only two like it in the world Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. \"It's a threat.\" They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her! What? Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly! Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her. And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden. You never made anything better. You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son. You go there with an army, it's an act of war. Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens. You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone? Not him. That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made. Take the head. Very good. No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself. You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin. He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same. The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers. The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have. Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title. The king is very busy at this moment. He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf. My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission. That is not your concern as Master of War. You would abandon your king in his time of need? You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters. There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock. Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? This is my real home now. Where my family lives. I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy. Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you. No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you. Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen. Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy. I'll leave you to it then. . There's no need for such formalities. Won't that be a lovely day. Remember. Anything you need. You were assaulted? What do you want from us, High Septon? And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow? Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow? A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he? Why no shoes? Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone? Perhaps they're right. An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say? The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you. My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another. Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. . How's your work coming along? You've made progress? Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word \"immediately\". How much can the Crown afford? You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them? You've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank. In person. We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified. The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. . He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort. Safe travels, Lord Tyrell. Not small enough. May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness? The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. . Hmm. All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets. Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven. If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy. An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven. Which is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most. What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege. Did I arrest him? I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions. I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy. The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden. The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion? House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys. Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning. She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him. If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king? Good. If there's nothing else. That's not possible. Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father. We were fools to trust a turncloak. I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil. Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor. Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn. My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse. Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back. Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man. And if you succeed? I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree. And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike. You must be exhausted. Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns. Beg your pardon. If you apologize for that comment perhaps-- I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do? I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains-- As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats-- The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare? House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna. This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden? Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love. No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control. You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be. We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair. Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic. Your happiness is all I want in this world No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy. This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind. We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods. You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down. I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins. Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever. Sleep well, sister. Yes. Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now? Who will stand judge? Will you be one of them? If one or both of them were to confess before the trial… What does The Mother's mercy entail? Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven. I think I may have heard at one point. I'm afraid i don't. Move. Let me go immediately. You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go! Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die. My son. Let me speak to-- My face will be the last thing you see before-- The charges? All lies. I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime? Tell him I need to speak to him. What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king-- You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother. I can't stay here. Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness. I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long. I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court. I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die. I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light-- Once I've confessed, will I be free? The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess. Lancel Lannister. I was lonely and afraid. A husband of whoring every chance he got. May the gods forgive me. No. I do. A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it. Trial? I have confessed? I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please. Thank you. Thank you. I will, I will. I swear it, day and night. Am I free to go? My atonement? Myrcella… Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body? All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth? I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse I have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone She was good From her first breath, she was so sweet I don't know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness, no jealous, just good I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I'm not a monster No, I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me they'd die “And gold their shrouds” Everything she said came true You couldn't have stopped it It's prophecy It's fate Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours That was a prophecy, too I didn't listen to you, and everything you said came true Get out of my way What are the king's orders? You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral? I would like to speak to my son Did they put her in the red gown or the gold? Good It was always her color I understand I'm glad to see you It's all right Always Varys's little birds The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one Not yet Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are Why are you here Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement? What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue? And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking. enters the room What are you doing here? Leave. Is this a Small Council meeting? Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things. As have we all, unfortunately. Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother? It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount. Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing. You've spoken with him? It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me. The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders. You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals. The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city. I agree. You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good? Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed. BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons. What, then? You can't. We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can. It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them. They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them. We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world. I heard you were leaving King's Landing. Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell? You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day. I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other. You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them. Never. I'll never leave my son. Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it. Who permitted them inside the Red Keep? The king is aware of their presence? His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep. It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing. He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial. Get out. I choose violence. Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit. There's to be a royal announcement? Why wasn't I informed? To stand by my son. And? Was it just a rumor or something more? Confess. Confess. Confess. Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances. You've always been quiet. I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember? What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor. This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too. Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now. Shame. Show me. He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood. Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not. It's ours now, we just have to take it. You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me? Are you afraid of me? Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land? Enemies to the east. Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches. Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor. Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed? Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers? I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years. A dynasty for us, then. There's nothing to say. He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children? I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count. I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that? You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing? Not all of them. I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are. So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing. Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that. A queen. If not the most humble. What do you want in return? I decline your proposal. You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother. If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty. You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons. It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her. No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room. They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion. You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown. And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism. You shall have what your heart desires -- when the war is won. With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country. I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking. The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that? It doesn't matter now. Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty. I imagine she is your favorite. I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love. I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating. We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice. Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast. I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull. She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right. Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it? That's the one. How long does the poison take? But death is certain? Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made. Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing. I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please. Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed. The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences. The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident. The Iron Bank wants its gold back. And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that. And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner. That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea. Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me. Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves? From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries? The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons? Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full. and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion. You're too kind, My Lord. Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself. We must devise a way to raise their spirits. My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it. It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos. That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me. How many men did we lose? It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries. They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be. So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make? turns and walks away from JAIME. Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son. You saw the crossbow, you saw his body. After all this time it still amazes me -- And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her? And you believed her? looks away, then sits down. I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming. So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his. That won't be necessary. He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here? pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable. What did our brother have to say? To discuss a surrender? She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now? smirks and looks away from JAIME. Are you going to punish him? Bronn. He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing? I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this. lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked. You. stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME. Do you remember what father used to say about people? Never betray me again. Why isn't she with them? And the rest of them? Including our brother. If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king. Where is she? Didn't travel with you? We've been here for some time. Sit down or leave. So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days? Then why are we here? I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement. I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce. That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men. The word of a would-be usurper. What are you talking about? He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy. In return, the King I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son. Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you. I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place. So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her. And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life. the destruction of this family. You killed our father Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father-- I will not hear it, not from you. I will not hear it! I will not It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future. Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction. What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen. But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her. Why? You said she'd destroy King's Landing. That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world. That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter. My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them. Ser Jaime. My lords, I need a moment with my brother. What are you doing? Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot? I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father. I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference? And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen-- Our child will rule Westeros. The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us. And then we rule. The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North. How many dragons did you see at the pit? What happened to the third? She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable. No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father-- Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen? And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen. You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy. And that will be treason. Disobeying your queen I told you no one walks away from me. There's one more yet to come. Good. Twenty-thousand men, is it? Horses? And elephants? That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants. In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland. You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest. After the war. That was our agreement. You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her. You're insolent. I've executed men for less. I wanted those elephants. You're insulting my late husband? Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body. You enjoy risking your neck, don't you? You're not boring, I'll give you that. You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that. But now I want to be alone. All we need is one good shot. The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another. Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man. The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today. The Red Keep is the safest place in the city. Ser Gregor, stay by my side. Ser Gregor, I command you. You're hurt. You're bleeding. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die. Please don't let me die. I don't want to die. Not like this. Not like this. Not like this. \n"

      "Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls. I did hear something about that. And the other brother? There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one. I hear he hates that nickname. Clever girl. Have you? The gods gave me one blessing. Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother? She has odd cravings, our sister. I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses. Close the door! Your uncle's in the Night's Watch. Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall. My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you? Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though. And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you. All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes. If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle. The greatest in the land. My spear never misses. Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies. None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted. One word and I'll hit you again. Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand? Do you understand? I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast... Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black. Beloved siblings. Apparently not. The Maester says the boy may live. Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you. Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers. And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world. Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say. My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family. Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one. Look at me and tell me what you see. What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years. Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard? A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms. Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly. A charming man. And how's that going, Commander Mormont? Good news or bad? I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you. It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it. Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up. You're joking? And how do a bear's balls taste? Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits? They have a better chance finding feed than glory. You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny. Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen? I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger. But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it. I think he's starting to like me. \"Going below\"? So you're heading down to King's Landing too. Let's share the road. I could use some decent company. Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister. Eight... no, nine. They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon. Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids. It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing. Of course. If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow. I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit. Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy? Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy. So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened? Curious. Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt. Do you like to ride, Bran? What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride. Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice. You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them. I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things. Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier. Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters. No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me? She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go? My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible? Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out. A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire. I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out. My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room. Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this? There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me. Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell. I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this. This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell. Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me? Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first. Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister? She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here. Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life! What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade? Why? Am I starting to make sense? Untie me. If I die, what's the point? Well, I'm willing if she is. The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable. I like you. Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man. If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do. Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord! How would you like to be rich? My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold. Well, I don't have it here. Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! About the gold - Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine. Where? I don't know where, but when they free me - Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do. Tell her I wish to confess my crimes. Yes, my lady. I do, my lady. Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel - Confessing my crimes. Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that. Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial. I understand the law. No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat. Agreed. Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you. I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister. Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait. Do I have a volunteer? Anyone?... Anyone? Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine. A Lannister always pays his debts. From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone. And feed it to the goats, yes. Uncle. Father. Sorry to disappoint you. May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister. We have our differences, Jaime and I. And the Starks? Lord Eddard? How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned? My sister rules, you mean. Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence. Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt. Shagga likes axes. The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines? Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay. Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort. lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords. Where did you find one so pretty at this hour? Took her? From whom? And he didn't have anything to say about it? Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow. Who are you? What did your mother call you? My mother died giving birth to me. What sort of accent is that? For- What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be. One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular. And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal? No. Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain? Let's play a new game. Does it involve the potential for losing fingers? No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at. l happen to be a great judge of character. lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying. Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you. You killed your first man before you were 12. You've been north of the Wall. And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty. lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore. All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return. And we've established the rules about lying? You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere. So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do? Are you sure – My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize. Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me. That's not how the game works. How did you hear that? Another night, perhaps. lt's not a pleasant story. So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed. lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father. Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor. Really? l was 16, drunk and in love. As l said, l was young and stupid. What is it? What do you want? What? Get my squire! lf l die, weep for me. l'll know. Stay low? l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours! To battle! l'm alive? Did we win? How did our tribesmen do? lt's nice to see them getting along. Good of you to notice. l hear we won. Did we get the Stark boy, at least? Where was he? And where are they? The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped. There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed. Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here. And do what? Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me? So it would seem. No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point. What? l believe he used the word \"whore\". My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – Beloved nephew. We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found. What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me. Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss. But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize. Of course you are. Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done. Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on. It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for. Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings. Yes, but in his absence… If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. . Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us. Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation. Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war? Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us. Joffrey is King. I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back. You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them. One? Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child. A bit corpsey, yes. I thought you wanted to come here. You love the smell of dead bodies and shit? You can smell cum from the balcony? And so did the country. Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here. You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars. Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth. Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth. Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here. You brought this on yourself. Do you understand we're losing the war? It was quite a battle. Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie. Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. . Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned. I don't like threats. I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played. And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea. You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith. Safe travels, cousin. You have a deft hand with diplomacy. Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall. Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them. According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie. Apparently you burn him. I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall. Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine. Myself, I prefer the improper ones. You know your wines, my lord. Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord. Wars have been started for less. I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night. Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies. Quite right. Especially the queen's orders. No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman. You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister. That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children. I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me. The fool! He had no idea you were already bought. I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence. Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here. I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about. The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend. No, we shan't. There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way. His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch. To the new Commander. If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question? I have every right. I am the King's Hand. Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me? You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it. It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse. I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that. As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon. She was my mother too. Keep your voice down. I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary. But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion. Kitchen wench. Yes, but- Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you. It's a compliment, my lady. Language can be a bit tricky here. Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days. Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side. Please. I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not? These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony. I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake. I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it. But remember, the Queen mustn't know. I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy. Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships. But remember, you must tell no one. I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones. For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think? Who better? The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal. Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands. You served my family well in the matter of the succession. I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then? Good. Oh. And remember- Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this. Dorne is the safest place for her. That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started. A guest. It's done, Cersei. You cannot stop it. Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours. No, afraid not. Sorry about that. Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too. Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in. No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again? Find him? No, you don't. You disappoint me, Grand Maester. So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne. See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you. Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats. Well, make do. How long have you been spying for my sister? I don't like his beard. How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn? So you poisoned him? But you let him die, made sure he succumbed. Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells. For your trouble. Good. One of my better ideas. The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave. Why, am I about to hear one? Depends on the sellsword. He has a sword, the power of life and death. I've decided I don't like riddles. What is the meaning of this? What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor? For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit. The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him? I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference? I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement? Lady Stark, you may survive us yet. You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him? Your visits are too few, cousin. So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep. If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that? And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei? And you've waited this long to deliver the information? Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf. She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn. Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl. An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser? Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother? Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight? Did he tell you to fuck her, too? Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this. Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel. No, I think not. You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me. Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent. Oh, I'll give her Pycelle. Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length. Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way. Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour. It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea. And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later. She'll be safer in Dorne. It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you. Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready. May I ask specifically what the king has in mind? It's important that we talk about this. Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin? MThat's a lie right there. Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean. The smart money would be on more likely. But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours. I suppose there's only one way to find out. When did she tell you this? Swear to me on what? But I don't care about your life. All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out. Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me. Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have? Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it. He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it. It's hard to argue with his assessment. The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now. You have to admire his imagination. What? Demon monkey? Blame me? I'm trying to save them. Demon monkey. I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, \"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. \" My companion takes issue. How much do you have? My friend remains unconvinced. I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me. Get the Prince back to the Keep now. Move. Move! Where's Sansa? Oh, you blind, bloody fool! We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. I can, I am. They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started. And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. Are you hurt, my lady? Well done, Clegane. Since when do you light your own candles? Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships. Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind. Rain fire on them from above.\" You're quoting Father, aren't you? Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead I thought the girls might help him. I was wrong. If we can't control him It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head. The boy is more Robert than Jaime. Sins? You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them. Do you have to do that here? Yes, but do you have to do it here? You should start wearing the gold cloak. You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out. Fine, fine. No gold cloak. What? What? What? Why are you staring at me? To help me plan the defense of King's Landing. Stannis will be here any day. An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. \" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh. I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery? For questioning? We talked about this. Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land. Pig shit. Thank you, Podrick. I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys. Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel. Younger boys are off fighting his war. What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen? It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us. No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence. He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert? Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it. Neither do you. It's not that little. Why are you smiling? And why are you happy? I thought you preferred blondes. Why do you care who I fuck? This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me. Where did you find her? You've forgotten the most important thing about whores. You don't buy them, you only rent them. And how do I know you haven't killed her already? I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave. I promise I will free you. Never. I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid. Shae! You're beautiful. We have to be more careful. There are people who want to hurt me. I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine. Promise me. To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way? A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you. Imagine Stannis' terror. You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man. I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men. What do you want? Tell me. My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock. The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand I do. Last thing I expected. I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over. The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine? We should sail there immediately. A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems. One game at a time, my friend. If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid. I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war. You can't fuck your way out of everything. A wedding. Is that it?\" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town. I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting. Oddly enough, I do. There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city. I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her. Well, I'm not. What of it? Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think? Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself. No, I don't believe you have. Remember, wait till the ships- They must be far enough in- I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood. Nor you, my friend. Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship. Oh! \"Enhances.\" Fancy word for a sellsword. Lady Sansa and Sheila. Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast. Always been a great romantic, my nephew. Will you? Stay safe, my lady. On the way. Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy. That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet. Archers to their marks. Hold fast. He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon. Rain fire on them. Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now. Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too? You're on the wrong side of the wall. You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city. If you won't defend your own city, why should they? Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them. I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack! Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you? There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses. Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape. Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them. Attack! Oh, fuck me. Pod. Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive. What happened? Where am I? Why should I believe you? To create strife between my sister and me. Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week? You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times. Then my hill tribesmen. Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends. It was good of you to come. Believe me, you don't. Well? I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double. That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me. Leave? What would we do in Pentos? I want to go with you. I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave? Pod? What are they doing here? No, I don't think so. They stay outside. Why are you here? The man who cut me lost more than his nose. Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me. Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees. How do you know that? What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came. Why do you care what I want from him? Slandered? When? You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe. She lost an eye, if I remember correctly. It's not slander if it's true. Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father? Any lies in particular? Still makes me more clever than you. A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me. Do you grow bored protecting me? Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch. I'm sure you filled your pockets. I thought we were friends. How much? Double? I don't even know how much I'm paying you now. The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position? I was very happy as Hand of the King. It wasn't your bed at the time. Occasionally I drank with the harlots. Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield. I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start. I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir. It is mine by right. Why? We've spoken of this. You cannot come here. Did anyone see you? No. You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain. All right. What is this problem? Baelish doesn't have friends. Oh, Ros? The redhead? I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need. Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things. Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice. But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else. Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger? Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger? We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name. Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you. I don't even want to talk about her. Only because you're making me. This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair. Hmm, yes. Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again. Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people. Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it. Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended. Master of Coin? I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it. A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers. Not for bastards. Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment. Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid. If only the Master of Coin had such power. Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding. We don't. I did fuck her once. But we don't. Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position? If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are. Good point. I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie. You think all reading is dull reading. The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages. Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up. Podrick. After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman? Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers. A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me. Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot. She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord. Be back in time for my supper. For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold. No. Worse, he's borrowing it. We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father. Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive. Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest. Well, you have to. This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back. Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step? You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth? Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year. Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year. Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them. What did you do to them? And they seemed to like these things? Only they weren't paid. Is that what you're telling us? Sit down, Podrick. We're going to need details. Copious details. I hope we might speak. In confidence. About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time? I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to- I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof. I need to know. I don't know. Do I? Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which- The sorcerer. Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters. It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it. It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used. I understand that. But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense. And we're at war, Lady Olenna. Yes, and maintaining supply lines- And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm. I would. My lady- Quite sufficient. Thank you. Give me that. What's she doing here? You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding. I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important. Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable. Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do. It wasn't my best, but- Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother. The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them? And how do we do that? Wonderful. You can't mean it. Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you. She's a child! And if I refuse? I was wed. Or don't you remember? I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this. It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery. On a boat you built. I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it. Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater? The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot. I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger. Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister. You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels. Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked. I beg your pardon, my lady. Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa. Alone, if I may. Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances. How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward. She's a child. A tall child. Not that young. Older. Shae isn't going to like it. I should never have told you about that. Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them. I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company. Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock. You could buy a ship with these. What? Of course you're not going anywhere. I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it. That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire. I don't have a choice. My father- What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock. My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her. I swear to you it will not be like that. I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for. Listen. Listen to me, my lady. You are. You'll always be my lady. Lady Sansa. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this. No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel. You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? Well, today you have to. Could you- Thank you. Of course. Of course. En-enjoy. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding? And? What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast. There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. There will be no bedding ceremony. Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock. A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there. I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood. Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long. Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly? Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can't. I could, I won't. If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to. And so my watch begins. You really ought to knock. Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. I have a list. For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand- My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp. The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other. Who? Whom? Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert. I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain. Lady Sansa! Why sheep shift? My lady- Killed a few puppies today? Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something? No. She is no longer yours to torment. Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies. You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper. A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king. No. I think armies give you power. Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same. Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances. I'm all for cheating. This is war. So that's why you did it? To save lives? The Northerners will never forget. Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother? I will not rape her. Use small words. I'm not as bright as you. No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions. When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family? Sansa. Keep up. It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy. She doesn't deserve this. There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher. Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit? I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage. So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it? You have children. How happy would you say you are? Even Joffrey? How long does it go on? Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more. Please don't. This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends. There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years. No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat. Ah, here we are. Can you read the sigils? Boy knows his Dornish Houses. And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear? Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company. Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast. And where is Prince Oberyn? Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep. You must be weary after such a long journey. We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies. You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go? Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be... trouble. I'm here to welcome you to the capital. If there's anything I can do to make your stay... Oh, I partook. Now I'm married. Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private? Oh, they take all kinds. The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding. Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult. Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn? I thought we were speaking truth. I wasn't actually present. I've heard rumors. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. My lady, you do need to eat. If I could have a moment alone with my wife. I can't let you starve. I swore to protect you. My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you. I don't know, but I can try. I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep. What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true. Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear. What are you doing? How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here. Of course I haven't forgotten. Things are a bit tense right now. My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister. I told you. It's not a good time. Shae. Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me. Of course I don't love her. Ship you away? What in the world are you talking about? Shh. I don't know what you're talking about. Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod? You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself. You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her. A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness. It's only wine. What about your left? You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword? Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand. You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one. Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king? Oh, to be foreign. So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie. Forgive me if I don't weep for you. She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it. The Lives of Four Kings.\" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read. Don't. Don't call me that. I'm afraid our friendship can't continue. There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos. You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants. I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows. I need to do right by her. By our children. I'm not afraid. I need you to leave. Shae. You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand? I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over. You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship. Better her than you. You saw her board the ship? You saw the ship sail away? How do you know? There's someone following you? Hello. My lady. My lady. Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done. We'll have to find another way to thank the king. One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled. Your Grace does me a great honor. Let's find out. I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace. If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired. Your Grace? Podrick. Apologies for the stench. A noble effort. You're a good lad. Any word of Shae? I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there? Do you believe I murdered Joffrey? No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet? Of course. Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote. Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy. Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa. Gone? No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick. They'll be following you now. I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go. Varys could vouch for me if he dared. Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him. Why not? And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime? Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him? Are you going to accept their offer? Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet. Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that. I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted. Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell. Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire. Is that supposed to make me feel better? It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister? Her son? My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed. So, should I turn around and close my eyes? The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son? Well, you could set me free. Then there's really nothing else to say. Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate. Except I didn't do it. Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died? No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway. Let me guess, I've been pardoned. Really? Well, we mustn't disappoint Father. No. Not that I know of. Choked on his pigeon pie. Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it. Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing? Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her. Father, may I ask the witness one question? You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys? Not going well, is it? Oh, you think so? Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out. How do you know? Shae. Please don't. Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess. I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all. Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear? No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf. Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life. Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it. I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat. I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit? Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it. Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son. At least I got to tell them what they really are. Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me. Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall. Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword. Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life. Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater. You have new clothes. I sent for you days ago. Doing what? Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl. She's dim-witted. When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister? And you understand the rules of inheritance? She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies. You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here? Is it two wives you want or two castles? I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude. You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts. My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it. Does he frighten you so much? Because you're my friend. I understand. Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place. Yes, we did. I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song? I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour. Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like. Oh. Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts. She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time. I think I would have remembered that. You and my family have more in common than you might admit. That would have made things so much easier. Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants. If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place. Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer? Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right? Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die. That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel? Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word. Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister? Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock. Nothing made him happier. On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else. For you. You drifted away. Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson. I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\" He gave me an answer. \"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!\" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library. Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"khuu, khuu, khuu\". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard \"khuu, khuu, khuu\" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason. I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once. He just pushed me aside with a \"khuu\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about? Looks like very light armor. You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight. It could get you killed. It could get me killed. Thank the gods. Oh, get on with it you son of a whore. What're you doing? Who's helping you? Varys? I suppose this is goodbye, then. Jaime, thank you. For my life. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All my life, you've wanted me dead. I loved her. Shae. I murdered her. With my own hands. It doesn't matter? Say that word again. I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why? I can't go back there. She's in there. I am your son. I have always been your son. I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail. Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes? Pentos? Much better. I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time. In a box. Why stop now? The future is shit. Just like the past. Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers. Not for a coward. You never told me why you set me free. You could have said no. Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing. A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms. You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me. I'm not well-suited for work. Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow. What is it you want exactly? Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place. I will never sit on the Iron Throne. Good luck finding him. Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen? There's a bug. When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box? I want to take a walk. She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere. You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis? And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen? We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it. I didn't rule. I was a servant. Managed to kill a lot of people. She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go. Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. I find us repulsive. You're right. Let's go for a walk. How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all? I have to get out of this wheelhouse. Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse. I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours. I'm losing my mind. Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf. Slaves. The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking. Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. . We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour? Come on. Let's find a brothel. It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock. See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust. Curious... hair. . It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter. Well, , she's taken. I need to speak to someone with hair. Hello? You've got no drink. Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it. That's because they've never met a queen. You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you. Because you have a skeptical mind. I'm, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm not. Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start. No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige. You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and - Thank you. . Who are you? Do you have wine? I can't sleep without wine. You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east. You said you were taking me to the Queen. What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself! Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen. What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine. I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not… I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria. Have you sailed this route before? You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough? You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom? Oh. The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then - And then they weren't. \"They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -\" I would clap. I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains. What was that? Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont! Mormont! Mormont! You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that. It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now? Without luck? That's the best idea you've had all day. So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots. You're not hungry? You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met. We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore… I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word. Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis. I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved. As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man. I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.” You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am. I only know what I heard He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men. Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion. I believe in many things. No. Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen. The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity? We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what? So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice? Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king? Why is it anchored? Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this! Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf? Guess again. The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms. Him. Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him! He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself. The Kingslayer! Wait! You have to buy me as well. We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too. Thank you my Lord. Thank you. My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage… What are you doing? It's true. He has. I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister. If only I were otherwise. You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time. Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service. When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least. Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you. Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name. I know. Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you. Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals? And did he? He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him. A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do. Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed? I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done. My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear. Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this. So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers. I've heard stories. To see if you were the right kind of terrible. The kind that prevents your people from being even more so. Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed. It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all. Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself. He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib. Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother. That's the one. Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting. No? Banish me? So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished... Advise you on what? The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else. I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good. And when you get back to your home, who supports you? Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough. It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it. The smaller man it is. There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time. It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor. My father would have liked you. Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles. You can end this. You can! Stay close! You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman. Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”. Rusty” Thank you. He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go. And I intend to help her do it. You betrayed her! And she exiled you, twice, I believe? Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont. Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep. Pardon me? Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful-- I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior. Middling. And drink. I've survived so far. I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me. Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade? If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies. I did miss you. We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid We'll be fine We're dressed like common merchants You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk? It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore...because you have no cock For your baby To eat I know what mhysa means Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with You can see why they're unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them It's a problem Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can't fight an enemy we don't know And have you started looking for that someone? Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time Meaning no offense He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes You think them Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere Perhaps they can tell us their secret What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid Daenerys is the dragon queen Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious Dragons do not do well in captivity That's what I do I drink and I know things The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or they'll waste away Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons? And did they ever harm you? Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend They will It's time they had their supper I'm friends with your mother I'm here to help Don't eat the help When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you “It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,” I told him “It could be little, like me” Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night But here you are Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about? You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here? That's good That's very good But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game You don't play games, either one of you, ever? There, that's a start Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games Until you do Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking Oh, you took your time You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen? You may be right Possibly It's a conversation Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends” Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution Long enough to know And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward Friends, friends, friends, please There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests… Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time Excellent I did I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels -- Soon You have my word And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace We offered terms Those men respect you As do I I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city For a short time You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage It's not enough. It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that. Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced. Who said anything about “him”? Welcome to Meereen. That's about the extent of my Valyrian. Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be. The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to -- Yes. She did indeed. Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths. I'd settle for obeyed. That sounds most excellent -- We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen. My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen. I'd call that a successful gambit. Look around. The city has come back to life. I did and it worked. Spoken like a man who has never had to shave. I'm going to miss you. I hope you're right about this expedition of yours. Most of all, we need our queen. Varys. The most famous dwarf in the world. I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself. Now it's like a man reborn. Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink? Why not? And who made these rules? Your former masters? Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me. And you? What's your excuse? That's how you know it's working. Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen. To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign. Do you like it? Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it. Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath. Grey worm? Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale... but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.” It's funnier in Westeros. Yes. A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps. Missandei, do you like the wine? Tell a joke. Ah! You lied to us. I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- - I was wrong. I admit it. The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- - And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- - All right, what should the army do? And then? Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise. Perhaps we should take shelter. Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you. Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters… it proves that no one needs a Master. Do we have a plan? You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates? Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him. You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach. We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults. Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven. It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying? Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen. Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes. It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well. Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we? We can agree upon that at least. With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet. The Seven Kingdoms. What if everyone starts demanding their independence? How did he take it? I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation. No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling. All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid? Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father. He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last. For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am. I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword. It's yours. Now and always. On a night like this, you came into the world. We won't stay on Dragonstone for long. Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes. We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south. Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who-- Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant. Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it? Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard? I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch. I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character. If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do. If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms. I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent. But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied. Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi. You are. Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing. The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei. The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it. The bastard of Winterfell. I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall. It's been a long road. But we're both still here. I'm Tyrion Lannister. and DAVOS shake hands. Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor. And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well. Does she miss me terribly? A sham marriage and unconsummated. Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on. Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North. A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it. Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south. I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do. Come. Their mother is waiting for you. Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth. Forever. Almost. I do. I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech. The Army of the Dead? No, I don't think you're either of those things. The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting -- whatever you saw beyond the wall. If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel. Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north. It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause. I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing. I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want. I wouldn't say we took your ship. Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men. I do actually. It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows. Good question. People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister. It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily. Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask. So do you have anything reasonable to ask? Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you. Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here. Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally. Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature. I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it. I don't remember. I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock. You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north. But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long. It's too great a risk. You're too important. Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready. No one has ever taken the rock. The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming. They will be ready. The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable. The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die. Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself. It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers. No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress. As a good friend of mine once said, \"give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.\" And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons. But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump. We took Casterly Rock. and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news. We still have the largest army. Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan. If I've underestimated our enemies -- We've discussed this. A smart one. walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak. is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position. Flee, you idiot! You fucking idiot. is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers. My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible. turns to speak to DAENERYS. Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall. You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee. turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear. Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell. Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families -- pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings. Your Grace -- All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do? I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her. Daenerys is not her father. looks down at the note in VARYS's hand. Who is that for? Did you read it? pauses and drinks from his cup of wine. What's it say? Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong? begins walking around the table closer to JON. So bring the dead to her. We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier. Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth. The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me. nods his head. Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow. turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand. begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat. You're not staying here? What if someone takes the boat? I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet. You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud. Listen to me -- glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand. It would take you awhile with a sparring sword. He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose -- Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms. I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request. Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach. He'll do. You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm. retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands. This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember? smiles and hands the coin to JORAH. Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you. is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table. turns to look at DAENERYS. I honestly don't. Oh. I've been heroic on occasion. I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing. It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you. Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance. A million, give or take. There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior. I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world. A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation. Supporting the enemy, no less. Cersei will anyway. Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion. I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. You've been thinking about our new queen. Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk. It's good to see you again. You might. And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through. She'll be here soon. No. We are all facing a unique I think we ought to begin with larger concerns. Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it. We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face. We all know that will never happen. There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you. I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked. Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister. I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble. She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister. You spoke with her? I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot? A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you. I didn't know about that. Cersei, I didn't know. I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have. After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me. I have never been more sorry about anything. All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me. If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father. I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know. I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it. If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come? Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something. Mm, not like this. Yes. Because I think she will make the world a better place. She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. You're pregnant. You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off. Because I have balls, and you don't. If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause. I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die. My lord. My lady. The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it. Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair. Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder. Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now. I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe- She did. She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive. One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway. And our queen is grateful. I sense that you're leading to a proposal. They do make a handsome couple. I'm not that old. Not as old as him. Our queen respects the wisdom of age. What is that? Your Grace, I know my brother- He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth? I was a fool. I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over. Well, here we are. Together again. And the masses rejoice. She's your new queen too. They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different. She is. I am. It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents. Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her. Was she lying about the baby too? She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway. So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and- My cock. At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men. Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart. How will he find you? When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench. Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives. Do you need help? You've had a strange journey. I'd like to hear about it. If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go. I wish Father were here. I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell. I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall. You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple. I was speaking in relative terms. Of course I miss it. It's not. Things would be easier if it were. The perils of self-betterment. To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either. And you? Ser Davos, join us. Would you like a drink? It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together. I think we might live. I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards. Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke. Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne. Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms! No, let's stay a bit longer. How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos? Ser Brienne? Mmm. If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference. What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate. And it made a difference. If I was out there right now... You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents. Maybe we should have stayed married. What a terrifying thought. Why not? Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no! A fitting reward for a hero. And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you. I'm sure you had your reasons. So did you? I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before. Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with. This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you. You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell. You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark. You don't want it. I envy you. Your Grace? There's something you need to know. Yes. Varys. He does. I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing. Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too. It was a mistake. She trusts me. If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone. But it doesn't matter now. It was me. The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen. They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages. What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns. I beg you, my queen- Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack. She wants to attack now. Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you? I drink to eat the skull keeper. I want to eat the skull keeper. I want to see the ... Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day. Ordered by whom? The queen herself? Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot. How did they find you? Did you consider taking it off? And you're going back to her, to die with her. She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action. Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise. You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now. She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be. The city will fall tomorrow. I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow. Why? Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life. There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again. Swear to me. If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered. I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates. If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible. Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood. You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had. If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men. I'll find you later. I'm going alone. I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city. Did you bring any wine? Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, \"See, I told you.\" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going. So is there life after death? I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen. I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not. Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting? She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all. Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood. My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day. The moment the gates fell, the battle was over. And she burned down a city for it. Would you have done it? You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down? Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know. It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men. When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise? I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother. You just came up with that? Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now? It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne? And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee? Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen. No. But you do. And you have to choose now. It's not for you to decide. You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen. You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one. Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her. Can't think of a worse choice. I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made. What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future? Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break. From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm. I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day? To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye. All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it. I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else. Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch. The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men. You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose. What we did. Ask me again in ten years. I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world. That's not- Uh- What's this? I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism. Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed. He's not kind? He what? What does he say about me? Your Grace. Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks. As you wish, Your Grace. We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign. That will improve. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid? Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard? Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair. Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population. Find the best builders and set them to the task. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel. \n"

      "Go on. Father's watching. And your mother. Don't think too much, Bran. Don't look away. Father will know if you do. You did well. What is it? Now there are five. You want to hold it? Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them. I'm not a Stark. Get on. Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king? Uncle Benjen! Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst. So take me with you when you go back. Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will. I'm ready to swear your oath. I don't care about that. What're you doing back there? You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother? Lord Eddard Stark is my father. What the hell do you know about being a bastard? I already have one. Of course I have. We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years. Soon enough. It's good you've got help. Impressive. I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully. Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself. So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough. You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance? First lesson I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know. I came to say goodbye to Bran. I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid. You Starks are hard to kill. She was very kind. It was always my color. And you, Stark. Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care? Why do you read so much? Is this a trick? Until your brother killed that King. Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf. The Night's Watch protects the realm from... It's an improvement. Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same. They hate me because I'm better than they are. You're leaving? What kind of reports? m ready. I won't let you down. But I'm better than every... Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me. I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister. Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South? If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could. He'll never walk again. Farewell, My Lord. Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it. Enough! He yielded. Are you sure you want to do this? I've had worse. It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself. The Wall's no place for cowards. Come stand by the fire. It's warmer. You're not. You're freezing. You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam? Yes, he is. Well… You can't get any worse. Watch duty. With Sam. He wasn't hungry. That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him. No one touches Sam. I wouldn't doubt it. Sally on the side? I didn't think you'd be so upset about it. As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you. I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but... I know where to put it. Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros. Red. You don't want to know. Better. What's my name? And why is my surname Snow? I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child. I build my own fires. Why is he alone? There's no rider. That's my Uncle Benjen's horse. I do, my lord. Yes, my lord. Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath. Do you take me for a servant? May I go? I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger. Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say. We should burn them. Is there any word of my father? My sisters were in King's Landing too. Soon, he says. This is Valyrian steel. My lord, you honor me, but l can't – Yes, my lord. l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight. At what? What is it? You can't what? And yet you really want to say. You want to say that… What? What about him? l should be there. l should be with him. Sam said you wanted to see me? No. He would do whatever was right, no matter what. Sam told you. And this is my day? ls that what you're saying? You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother. Who are you? You're Aemon Targaryen. Get out of my way, Sam. Better than you do. l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. Move. Hyah! Ghost? l belong with my brother. They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back. l have to. I don't care about – To hell with all of you. My friends brought me back. They killed my father. No. Beyond the Wall? Having a rough time of it? What happens to the boys? He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons? We're not Southerners. Jon Snow. Lord commander. Your steward. What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons? What're you doing? Hello, Gilly. What're you doing? I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to - What? . No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible. Sam we can't take her - It's just not possible. If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why. Do what, ask her a question? Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand? No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that? We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You? I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her. Lord Commander- I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn. No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys... You know. Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster. I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child. When will he come? My uncle told me stories about him. I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall. So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own. I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts. Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand. A fire. Where? Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin. I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that? Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! He's not a pet. Ghost is different. I thought you said you couldn't know wild things. We could do the same. My father always said I'm of the North. I wasn't joking. I'll gladly give my life. I do. A girl. We could question her. What's your name? I'm Jon Snow. No. No, I'll do it. I'm as much a crow as they are. Can't. Someone might see the smoke. I'll find them. We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. There's no shelter anywhere. No fire. Yes. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. Stop it! You're still moving. Let's move. I'm a man of the Night's Watch. Don't call them that. Neither. Both. Move! There are no women of the Night's Watch, no. No. Never. We swore an oath. Would you please shut up? You're a free woman? If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"prisoner\" means. It was my choice to say the words. Of course I like girls. That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch. Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy! My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours. No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall. Walk. I know how to do it. We're close. Nothing happened between you and me. Turn back around. What, right here in the muck? That's enough. Enough! I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't- The others? They died because of me. They'll never trust me. What? I didn't. Careful with that. You might cut yourself. Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle. Stop! Mance was a ranger. When I'm free, will I be free to go? What happened to their fathers? My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts. Jon Snow. Your Grace. The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning. He wants me to lead one day. If I'm a traitor, then you are, too. I want to be free. We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw... I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place? Don't think too much, Bran. Relax your bow arm. Yes. I understand. You want to protect your people. No. What's wrong with him? It's only horses. No men. About three hundred. Do you think anyone got away? There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies. It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you. Three. Castle Black. Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower. A thousand. What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground? A thousand men. I don't need you to protect me. Give it back. Ygritte! Ygritte! Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte! Ygritte. We shouldn't. I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all. You seemed to like it. There's been no one else. Only you. I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid? Who was he? Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund- You ever climbed it before? Aren't you? You kill someone for them? Can we not talk about that here? Did I seem scared the other day? Only in the beginning. What secret? I won't. Take my hand! About a week, I think. When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad. Most of the time, yes. They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil. Usually it's the young boys banging the drums. They help the men march. Well, it's- it's the rhythm. No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming. I know you cut me loose on the Wall. And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird? You're gonna scare it off. It's too far away. It's a windmill. Just the men who used to live here. Winterfell has towers three times that size. If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell. Fainting. When a girl sees blood and collapses. Well not all girls are like you. I'd like to see you in a silk dress. So I could tear it off you. Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell. Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that. Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed. Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same. You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together. I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you. Yes, first we'll live. He breeds them for the Watch. The Watch protects him. We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat. The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers. Ygritte! You were right the whole time. Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am. I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me. I do know some things. I know I love you. I know you love me. But I have to go home now. Pyp? Sam? Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. \"He said, \" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could. He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance. I've done plenty wrong. I didn't murder him. He wanted me to kill him. The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army. Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him... Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl. I do. While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000. 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him. Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser? And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job. There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go? Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them. Help him. And the mutineers stayed? We need to ride north and kill them all. It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them. Bring it through! And again. Very nice. Good. A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds. Let's see what you can do. Olly, you just watch for now. Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet. You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other. You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him. Grenn and I were helping them. Someone has to train them. My father was highborn. My mother wasn't. Jon Snow. You fight well. She wasn't safe here. Castle Black could be next. We have orders. No one's to leave the castle. And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him. How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton? The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except... Thank you, Ser Alliser. Ahem, brothers. I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me? I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall. Thank you, brothers. How many? Why? Get some rest. We move at sundown. Are you all right? Come with me. Come on. We lost four brothers? I count ten dead mutineers. Where in seven hells? Come here. I missed you, boy. It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe. You want to stay here in Craster's Keep? Greetings. Come on, Ghost. Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon. We need to prepare. We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze. We wouldn't. Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have. They won't stop them. The stewards. No. The builders. You couldn't have known. We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want. If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close. She...she had red hair. Well what do you want me to say? So you and Gilly never- But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows? What? I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation. It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet! And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart. There will. Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch. There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser. Yes sir. It was a difficult decision either way, Ser. We can't just let them attack the gate! Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them? Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose! They won't summit before dawn. Because I've made that claim. Knock! Draw! Loose! Now! to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate. grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through... Oil! What are you doing up here? Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them. Two brothers now fight with me. to Sam* I don't want you out there. I need him more than I need you. No, shh, don't talk. We'll go back there. Tormund. It's over, let it end. Put him in chains. We'll question him later. Aye, you shouldo ve. For one night. Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them. I'm going to find Mance. Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home. I'm going to try. He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too. You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan? They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out. I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back. I've been sent to negotiate with you. The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows. She put three arrows in me when I escaped. Yes. She's dead. No. Ygritte. That's not wine. He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn. Grenn came from a farm. Grenn and Mag. Turn your army around and go home. I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men. No, it's like you said, we don't have the men. I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall. I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son. He was, your grace. I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say. Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them. He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe. No one's going to torture you. I don't know what happens to the prisoners. I suppose Stannis does. I don't have a king. We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them? Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it. Say farewell. She told you? Get your shield up. If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up. Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell. Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up! You're not cold, my lady? No. Roose Bolton. I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now. They're good men. It's where she belonged. They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters. The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part-- Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army? I don't think that's likely. I respect him. Your grace… How much time do I have? Here we are. This doesn't have to be our last meeting. You know what Stannis wants? Shouldn't a king be bold? You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough. You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? Then bend the knee and save your people. And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid. They'll burn you alive. And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing. I think you're making a terrible mistake. With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive. No. Only one of their own. The Lord Commander's niece. Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark. I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own. Most likely. Unpleasant, I expect. I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you. I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow. It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again. I'm going to refuse him. I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be? Your Grace. Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command. I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here. I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch. I can imagine no higher praise. May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black? You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming. And the wildlings? Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. . I heard it was best to keep your enemies close. I'm sorry I disappointed him. As long as he's ruling them. I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. And what needs to be done? Sam. . Maester Aemon? Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger. Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger. Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard. Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his - You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard. Are you refusing to obey my order? Take Lord Janos outside. Olly, bring me my sword. If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time. Good. Never even heard of these people. And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us? Not him. He murdered my brother. How can I help you? Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions. I don't think Stannis would like that very much. I can't. I swore a vow. . I loved another. I know. But I still love her. Maester Aemon. Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone. How are you feeling? I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order. But you don't know what it is. Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them? What about you? What if I unchained you? Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours. For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you. It is. Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall. I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes. And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward. Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people. Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week. I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet. Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing. And we've slaughtered theirs. You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that. Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right. It's not a trick. I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone. No. You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you. First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black. As always, thank you for your honesty. Thank you, Sam. Me too. Does that make me a fool? He's not my prisoner. We're allies. We're not here to fight. We're here to talk. My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there. In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them. It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us. Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker. No. But I trust the man. Come with me and I'll share these weapons. There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands. I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life. If you swear you join us when the real war begins. He died. I put an arrow through his heart. I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight. How many are with us? 5000? We're leaving too many behind. And he knew them better than I ever will. Get in line! Get in line! Hold the line! Hold the line! Get them to the ship and come back for me! Now! You should be on one of those boats. You have my word. I've given orders. Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move! The Dragonglass! Go! Go! Go! Let's go now! Now! It was a failure. I went to save them, I failed. I don't think that fact's lost on them. Here's a silver because the lady likes you. He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world. I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall. No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it. With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw… Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? Here's to us then. Long may they sneer. What? I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust? You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too. Sam? Sam… You've just been beaten half to death. How did you-- I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone. To your return. We don't have enough men to make any difference. The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before-- It's not their fight! Stannis? Are you sure he's talking about Benjen? He could be lying. Where is he? Olly… They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here Nothing There was nothing at all I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why? I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed I'm not a god I think so Hold off on burning my body for now If you have any last words, now is the time Neither was killing me I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser You should Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black My watch is ended South Get warm I did everything I could You know that Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life They killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that? With the peas and onions? We never should have left Winterfell How could we know? We were children You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played There's nothing to forgive All right All right, I forgive you You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me I can't stay here, not after what happened Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave? I don't have an army They didn't come here to serve me Sansa I'm tired of fighting It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost I'm not Lord Commander anymore. SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading. To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. SNOW looks at SANSA. His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You -- It's just more of the same. SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading. Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. We don't know that. How many do you have? SNOW nods. We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men. There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build. How do you know that? New dress? Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit. Thank you, Sansa. Don't knock it down while I'm gone. That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive. Are you sure they'll come? Lady Mormont. I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- - Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- - Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance. Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- - Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost. Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect? 62? Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- - House Mormont. We sent raven to Houses Manderly- - The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings. Lord Glover. We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day.. We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can. Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years. There's no time. We fight with the army we have. You don't have to be here. You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me. Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them? If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out. It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning... We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment. A pincer move. They won't be able to hit us from the sides. No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt. Aye, for what they're worth. You're right. He's overconfident. Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton. All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back? We can't give up on our brother. Of course he does. What should I do differently? Aye, that's good advice. Well, it is a bit obvious. When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men! Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds. SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise. My lady. You weren't at the war council. Any advice? If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back. I'm ordering you not to bring me back. You're in my camp. I'm the commander. How do you know what he commands? Why? What kind of god would do something like that? Get word -- We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father. When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there. Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most. What is that? Do you have anything to say for yourself? Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer. I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you. I'm not a Stark. You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons. And you trust him? We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. Well, Father always promised, didn't he? The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield. The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm. There's nothing to forgive, my lord. I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow. Not just the boys. We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting. While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk. But if we're going to survive this winter together... Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold. The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation. I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons. The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle. When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, \"The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,\" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final. Ned Umber. Alys Karstark. For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon. Stand. Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always? You are my sister, but I am king now. When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me. Of course you can, but-- Do you think I'm Joffrey? Thank you. At what? No. What did father used to say? Everything before the word \"but\" is horse shit. No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls. All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me. And how should I be smarter? By listening to you? Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms-- Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors. I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too. There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north. You almost sound as if you admire her. Read the last bit. It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think? What? But? Come in. This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass. I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister. He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons. Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept. We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons. But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone. I know that. It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man. You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it. Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me. I'm leaving both in good hands. Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours. You don't belong down here. I have nothing to say to you. Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself. The dwarf of Casterly Rock. You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road. Of course. She is. I didn't ask -- She's starting to let on. As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen. My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here. True. But I'm not a Stark. The winds were kind, Your Grace. I am not. Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms. You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows. Because I need your help and you need mine. I did. They're hard to miss. But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei. Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair. Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north. I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy. The Army of the Dead is on the march. You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman? The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves -- we're finished. You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King. There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating -- And why would I do that? I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can. Am I your prisoner? I'm a prisoner on this island. Except to my ship. They took my ship. I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all. It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King -- You probably don't believe me. You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense. How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all? I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer. I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave. Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool. What do you mean? Amazing thing to see. You've been talking to Tyrion? He enjoys talking. I don't. I never expected that you would. I haven't either. Thank you. So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead? Your Grace. I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits. leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave. So this is it, all we'll ever need. There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace. and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass. The Children of the Forest made these. A very long time ago. No. They were here together the Children and the First Men. takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers. and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King. Because the enemy is real. It's always been real. No, I don't think I can. My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered. and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion. I would never presume to -- looks over the ocean at the dragons flying. I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known. glances back towards the dragons. But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same. and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion. Who? I think she has a good heart. There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less? What? It doesn't matter. Of course. I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married. Why did you leave your homeland? I'm sorry. And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow -- You believe that? notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look. Is that a Greyjoy ship? grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face. What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you. releases THEON. The queen is gone. SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away. That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts. You weren't gone long. And? pauses and doesn't say anything. No, I'm not. Thousands. Ser Davos gets carried away. doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue. I served with your father. He was a great man. I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead. Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall -- interrupts VARYS. I need to go home. We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us. I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation. The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall. pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence. The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone. They won't have to. I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them. With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance. stops and turns around to face DAVOS. You survived King's Landing. Your Grace, this is -- looks to DAVOS. I saw your father once at Winterfell. You're a lot leaner. stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles. I grew up on stories about them. Do you know how to use one? Well, that's a problem. nods. We could use the help. If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace. Heave! and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle. Two. Both. looks around the table. Not enough. smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed. You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell. He's right. We're all on the same side. We're all breathing. Are you all right? Ever been north before? You've never been down south. That's the north. There's not another woman within 100 miles of here. glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND. Davos says he is a strong fighter. She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee. The first time I went north of the wall was with your father. I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice. I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block. I heard. I'm glad he didn't capture you. stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword. Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw. hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands. Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it. I'm not his son. Who's that? You knew him? I serve the north. The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me. Why? That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants. So what are you fighting for? But we all die. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. Aye. Maybe that's enough. How many people live here? That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way? This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead. This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't. We can destroy them by burning them. And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world. There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here. No. I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. I know! I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father. I did this. I should go. No one is less happy about this than I am. You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here. Who told you that? Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information? So, what now? It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked. If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight. It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message. All right. We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together. It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret. No. Not compared to you. Our father was more of a father. And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory. But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me. It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark. So, why are you still talking to me? I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders. Look at you. You're a man. Where's Arya? Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell. We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here. It's not important. You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North. How did you sneak up on me? I didn't. You still have it. Have you ever used it? Jealous? Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa. Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone. Now you're defending her? You? Yeah. I'm her family too. She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up. What's the matter? What's wrong with them? I don't know how to ride a dragon. What if he doesn't want me to? What do I hold onto? You've completely ruined horses for me. We'd be pretty old. It's cold up here for a southern girl. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.\" Isn't that what he said? I told you we needed allies. I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons. Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance. Do you have any faith in me at all? She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father. Sam? Were you hiding from me? What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already? What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right? Little Sam? Know what? I'm so sorry. We need to end this war. Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me. I wasn't a king. I gave up my crown, Sam. I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore. What are you talking about? My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life. Daenerys is our queen. That's treason. We need every man we can get. I thought we'd lost you. How did you find each other? The Umbers? How long do we have? They're coming. We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel. But there are too many of them. Far too many. Our enemy doesn't tire. Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel. We can't beat them in a straight fight. The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance. We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest. If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does. Let's get some rest. Your Grace. No. Gilly? Little Sam? If you want to join them. To protect them. Now it's just us three. Lyanna Stark. He didn't. He loved her. They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard. My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen. I wish it were. Bran. He saw it. And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant. It's true, Dany. I know it is. The Night King is coming. Dany! Get off! Bran! We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again. Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she? She shouldn't be alone. Aren't you worried for her? We're not much for riddles where I'm from. That's her decision to make. She is our queen. What do you want? I don't want it. I never have. She is my queen. I don't want it, and that's what I told him. I love you. And you will always be my queen. Daybreak at the earliest. Move, move! No! Get back! Get back! Stay! Stay! Stop! Find somewhere to hide. We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back! Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! It's not safe. Let me send some men with you. Grey Worm! It's over. And what are the queen's commands? What are you doing here? Hey, what happened? She's everyone's queen now. Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you. No. Not that I've seen. You didn't. I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now. And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today. You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister. Cersei left her no choice. She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky. Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield. What? I don't know. What's it matter what I'd do? Love is the death of duty. Maester Aemon said it a long time ago. That's her decision. She is the queen. I'm sorry it came to this. My sisters will be loyal to the throne. She doesn't get to choose. I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders. Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned! And Tyrion? Forgive him. You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand. Please, Dany. The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be. How do you know? How do you know it'll be good? I don't. What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good. You are my queen. Now, and always. There's still a Night's Watch? Was it right? What I did? It doesn't feel right. I don't expect we'll ever see each other again. The North is free, thanks to you. Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for. You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black. You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed? You have your Needle? Your Grace. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me. \n"
