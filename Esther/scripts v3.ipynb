      "Go on. Father's watching. And your mother. Don't think too much, Bran. Don't look away. Father will know if you do. You did well. What is it? Now there are five. You want to hold it? Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them. I'm not a Stark. Get on. Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king? Uncle Benjen! Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst. So take me with you when you go back. Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will. I'm ready to swear your oath. I don't care about that. What're you doing back there? You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother? Lord Eddard Stark is my father. What the hell do you know about being a bastard? I already have one. Of course I have. We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years. Soon enough. It's good you've got help. Impressive. I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully. Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself. So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough. You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance? First lesson I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know. I came to say goodbye to Bran. I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid. You Starks are hard to kill. She was very kind. It was always my color. And you, Stark. Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care? Why do you read so much? Is this a trick? Until your brother killed that King. Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf. The Night's Watch protects the realm from... It's an improvement. Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same. They hate me because I'm better than they are. You're leaving? What kind of reports? m ready. I won't let you down. But I'm better than every... Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me. I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister. Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South? If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could. He'll never walk again. Farewell, My Lord. Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it. Enough! He yielded. Are you sure you want to do this? I've had worse. It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself. The Wall's no place for cowards. Come stand by the fire. It's warmer. You're not. You're freezing. You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam? Yes, he is. Well… You can't get any worse. Watch duty. With Sam. He wasn't hungry. That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him. No one touches Sam. I wouldn't doubt it. Sally on the side? I didn't think you'd be so upset about it. As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you. I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but... I know where to put it. Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros. Red. You don't want to know. Better. What's my name? And why is my surname Snow? I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child. I build my own fires. Why is he alone? There's no rider. That's my Uncle Benjen's horse. I do, my lord. Yes, my lord. Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath. Do you take me for a servant? May I go? I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger. Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say. We should burn them. Is there any word of my father? My sisters were in King's Landing too. Soon, he says. This is Valyrian steel. My lord, you honor me, but l can't – Yes, my lord. l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight. At what? What is it? You can't what? And yet you really want to say. You want to say that… What? What about him? l should be there. l should be with him. Sam said you wanted to see me? No. He would do whatever was right, no matter what. Sam told you. And this is my day? ls that what you're saying? You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother. Who are you? You're Aemon Targaryen. Get out of my way, Sam. Better than you do. l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. Move. Hyah! Ghost? l belong with my brother. They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back. l have to. I don't care about – To hell with all of you. My friends brought me back. They killed my father. No. Beyond the Wall? Having a rough time of it? What happens to the boys? He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons? We're not Southerners. Jon Snow. Lord commander. Your steward. What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons? What're you doing? Hello, Gilly. What're you doing? I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to - What? . No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible. Sam we can't take her - It's just not possible. If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why. Do what, ask her a question? Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand? No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that? We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You? I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her. Lord Commander- I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn. No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys... You know. Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster. I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child. When will he come? My uncle told me stories about him. I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall. So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own. I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked. One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts. Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand. A fire. Where? Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin. I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that? Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! He's not a pet. Ghost is different. I thought you said you couldn't know wild things. We could do the same. My father always said I'm of the North. I wasn't joking. I'll gladly give my life. I do. A girl. We could question her. What's your name? I'm Jon Snow. No. No, I'll do it. I'm as much a crow as they are. Can't. Someone might see the smoke. I'll find them. We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. There's no shelter anywhere. No fire. Yes. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. Stop it! You're still moving. Let's move. I'm a man of the Night's Watch. Don't call them that. Neither. Both. Move! There are no women of the Night's Watch, no. No. Never. We swore an oath. Would you please shut up? You're a free woman? If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what \"prisoner\" means. It was my choice to say the words. Of course I like girls. That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch. Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy! My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours. No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall. Walk. I know how to do it. We're close. Nothing happened between you and me. Turn back around. What, right here in the muck? That's enough. Enough! I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't- The others? They died because of me. They'll never trust me. What? I didn't. Careful with that. You might cut yourself. Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle. Stop! Mance was a ranger. When I'm free, will I be free to go? What happened to their fathers? My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts. Jon Snow. Your Grace. The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning. He wants me to lead one day. If I'm a traitor, then you are, too. I want to be free. We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw... I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place? Don't think too much, Bran. Relax your bow arm. Yes. I understand. You want to protect your people. No. What's wrong with him? It's only horses. No men. About three hundred. Do you think anyone got away? There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies. It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you. Three. Castle Black. Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower. A thousand. What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground? A thousand men. I don't need you to protect me. Give it back. Ygritte! Ygritte! Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte! Ygritte. We shouldn't. I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all. You seemed to like it. There's been no one else. Only you. I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid? Who was he? Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund- You ever climbed it before? Aren't you? You kill someone for them? Can we not talk about that here? Did I seem scared the other day? Only in the beginning. What secret? I won't. Take my hand! About a week, I think. When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad. Most of the time, yes. They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil. Usually it's the young boys banging the drums. They help the men march. Well, it's- it's the rhythm. No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming. I know you cut me loose on the Wall. And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird? You're gonna scare it off. It's too far away. It's a windmill. Just the men who used to live here. Winterfell has towers three times that size. If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell. Fainting. When a girl sees blood and collapses. Well not all girls are like you. I'd like to see you in a silk dress. So I could tear it off you. Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell. Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that. Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed. Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same. You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together. I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you. Yes, first we'll live. He breeds them for the Watch. The Watch protects him. We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat. The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers. Ygritte! You were right the whole time. Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am. I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me. I do know some things. I know I love you. I know you love me. But I have to go home now. Pyp? Sam? Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. \"He said, \" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.\" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could. He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance. I've done plenty wrong. I didn't murder him. He wanted me to kill him. The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army. Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him... Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl. I do. While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000. 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him. Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser? And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job. There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth. Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go? Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them. Help him. And the mutineers stayed? We need to ride north and kill them all. It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them. Bring it through! And again. Very nice. Good. A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds. Let's see what you can do. Olly, you just watch for now. Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet. You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other. You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him. Grenn and I were helping them. Someone has to train them. My father was highborn. My mother wasn't. Jon Snow. You fight well. She wasn't safe here. Castle Black could be next. We have orders. No one's to leave the castle. And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him. How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton? The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except... Thank you, Ser Alliser. Ahem, brothers. I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me? I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall. Thank you, brothers. How many? Why? Get some rest. We move at sundown. Are you all right? Come with me. Come on. We lost four brothers? I count ten dead mutineers. Where in seven hells? Come here. I missed you, boy. It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe. You want to stay here in Craster's Keep? Greetings. Come on, Ghost. Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon. We need to prepare. We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze. We wouldn't. Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have. They won't stop them. The stewards. No. The builders. You couldn't have known. We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want. If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close. She...she had red hair. Well what do you want me to say? So you and Gilly never- But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows? What? I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation. It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet! And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart. There will. Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch. There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser. Yes sir. It was a difficult decision either way, Ser. We can't just let them attack the gate! Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them? Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose! They won't summit before dawn. Because I've made that claim. Knock! Draw! Loose! Now! to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate. grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through... Oil! What are you doing up here? Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them. Two brothers now fight with me. to Sam* I don't want you out there. I need him more than I need you. No, shh, don't talk. We'll go back there. Tormund. It's over, let it end. Put him in chains. We'll question him later. Aye, you shouldo ve. For one night. Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them. I'm going to find Mance. Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home. I'm going to try. He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too. You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan? They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out. I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back. I've been sent to negotiate with you. The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows. She put three arrows in me when I escaped. Yes. She's dead. No. Ygritte. That's not wine. He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn. Grenn came from a farm. Grenn and Mag. Turn your army around and go home. I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men. No, it's like you said, we don't have the men. I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall. I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son. He was, your grace. I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say. Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them. He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe. No one's going to torture you. I don't know what happens to the prisoners. I suppose Stannis does. I don't have a king. We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them? Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it. Say farewell. She told you? Get your shield up. If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up. Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell. Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up! You're not cold, my lady? No. Roose Bolton. I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now. They're good men. It's where she belonged. They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters. The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part-- Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army? I don't think that's likely. I respect him. Your grace… How much time do I have? Here we are. This doesn't have to be our last meeting. You know what Stannis wants? Shouldn't a king be bold? You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough. You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? Then bend the knee and save your people. And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid. They'll burn you alive. And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing. I think you're making a terrible mistake. With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive. No. Only one of their own. The Lord Commander's niece. Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark. I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own. Most likely. Unpleasant, I expect. I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you. I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow. It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again. I'm going to refuse him. I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be? Your Grace. Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command. I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark. But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here. I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch. I can imagine no higher praise. May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black? You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming. And the wildlings? Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. . I heard it was best to keep your enemies close. I'm sorry I disappointed him. As long as he's ruling them. I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. And what needs to be done? Sam. . Maester Aemon? Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger. Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger. Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard. Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his - You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard. Are you refusing to obey my order? Take Lord Janos outside. Olly, bring me my sword. If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time. Good. Never even heard of these people. And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us? Not him. He murdered my brother. How can I help you? Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions. I don't think Stannis would like that very much. I can't. I swore a vow. . I loved another. I know. But I still love her. Maester Aemon. Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone. How are you feeling? I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order. But you don't know what it is. Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them? What about you? What if I unchained you? Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours. For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you. It is. Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall. I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes. And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward. Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people. Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week. I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet. Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing. And we've slaughtered theirs. You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that. Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right. It's not a trick. I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone. No. You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you. First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black. As always, thank you for your honesty. Thank you, Sam. Me too. Does that make me a fool? He's not my prisoner. We're allies. We're not here to fight. We're here to talk. My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there. In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them. It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us. Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker. No. But I trust the man. Come with me and I'll share these weapons. There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands. I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life. If you swear you join us when the real war begins. He died. I put an arrow through his heart. I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight. How many are with us? 5000? We're leaving too many behind. And he knew them better than I ever will. Get in line! Get in line! Hold the line! Hold the line! Get them to the ship and come back for me! Now! You should be on one of those boats. You have my word. I've given orders. Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move! The Dragonglass! Go! Go! Go! Let's go now! Now! It was a failure. I went to save them, I failed. I don't think that fact's lost on them. Here's a silver because the lady likes you. He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world. I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall. No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it. With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw… Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? Here's to us then. Long may they sneer. What? I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust? You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too. Sam? Sam… You've just been beaten half to death. How did you-- I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone. To your return. We don't have enough men to make any difference. The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before-- It's not their fight! Stannis? Are you sure he's talking about Benjen? He could be lying. Where is he? Olly… They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here Nothing There was nothing at all I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why? I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed I'm not a god I think so Hold off on burning my body for now If you have any last words, now is the time Neither was killing me I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser You should Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black My watch is ended South Get warm I did everything I could You know that Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life They killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that? With the peas and onions? We never should have left Winterfell How could we know? We were children You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played There's nothing to forgive All right All right, I forgive you You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me I can't stay here, not after what happened Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave? I don't have an army They didn't come here to serve me Sansa I'm tired of fighting It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost I'm not Lord Commander anymore. SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading. To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. SNOW looks at SANSA. His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You -- It's just more of the same. SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading. Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. We don't know that. How many do you have? SNOW nods. We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men. There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build. How do you know that? New dress? Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit. Thank you, Sansa. Don't knock it down while I'm gone. That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive. Are you sure they'll come? Lady Mormont. I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- - Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- - Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance. Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- - Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost. Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect? 62? Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- - House Mormont. We sent raven to Houses Manderly- - The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings. Lord Glover. We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day.. We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can. Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years. There's no time. We fight with the army we have. You don't have to be here. You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me. Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them? If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out. It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning... We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment. A pincer move. They won't be able to hit us from the sides. No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt. Aye, for what they're worth. You're right. He's overconfident. Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton. All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back? We can't give up on our brother. Of course he does. What should I do differently? Aye, that's good advice. Well, it is a bit obvious. When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men! Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds. SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise. My lady. You weren't at the war council. Any advice? If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back. I'm ordering you not to bring me back. You're in my camp. I'm the commander. How do you know what he commands? Why? What kind of god would do something like that? Get word -- We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father. When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there. Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most. What is that? Do you have anything to say for yourself? Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer. I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you. I'm not a Stark. You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons. And you trust him? We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. Well, Father always promised, didn't he? The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield. The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm. There's nothing to forgive, my lord. I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow. Not just the boys. We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting. While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk. But if we're going to survive this winter together... Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold. The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation. I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons. The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle. When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, \"The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,\" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final. Ned Umber. Alys Karstark. For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon. Stand. Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always? You are my sister, but I am king now. When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me. Of course you can, but-- Do you think I'm Joffrey? Thank you. At what? No. What did father used to say? Everything before the word \"but\" is horse shit. No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls. All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me. And how should I be smarter? By listening to you? Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms-- Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors. I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too. There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north. You almost sound as if you admire her. Read the last bit. It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think? What? But? Come in. This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass. I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister. He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons. Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept. We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons. But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone. I know that. It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man. You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it. Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me. I'm leaving both in good hands. Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours. You don't belong down here. I have nothing to say to you. Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself. The dwarf of Casterly Rock. You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road. Of course. She is. I didn't ask -- She's starting to let on. As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen. My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here. True. But I'm not a Stark. The winds were kind, Your Grace. I am not. Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms. You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows. Because I need your help and you need mine. I did. They're hard to miss. But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei. Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair. Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north. I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy. The Army of the Dead is on the march. You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman? The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves -- we're finished. You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King. There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating -- And why would I do that? I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can. Am I your prisoner? I'm a prisoner on this island. Except to my ship. They took my ship. I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all. It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King -- You probably don't believe me. You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense. How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all? I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer. I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave. Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool. What do you mean? Amazing thing to see. You've been talking to Tyrion? He enjoys talking. I don't. I never expected that you would. I haven't either. Thank you. So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead? Your Grace. I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits. leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave. So this is it, all we'll ever need. There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace. and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass. The Children of the Forest made these. A very long time ago. No. They were here together the Children and the First Men. takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers. and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King. Because the enemy is real. It's always been real. No, I don't think I can. My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered. and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion. I would never presume to -- looks over the ocean at the dragons flying. I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known. glances back towards the dragons. But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same. and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion. Who? I think she has a good heart. There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less? What? It doesn't matter. Of course. I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married. Why did you leave your homeland? I'm sorry. And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow -- You believe that? notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look. Is that a Greyjoy ship? grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face. What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you. releases THEON. The queen is gone. SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away. That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts. You weren't gone long. And? pauses and doesn't say anything. No, I'm not. Thousands. Ser Davos gets carried away. doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue. I served with your father. He was a great man. I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead. Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall -- interrupts VARYS. I need to go home. We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us. I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation. The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall. pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence. The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone. They won't have to. I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them. With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance. stops and turns around to face DAVOS. You survived King's Landing. Your Grace, this is -- looks to DAVOS. I saw your father once at Winterfell. You're a lot leaner. stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles. I grew up on stories about them. Do you know how to use one? Well, that's a problem. nods. We could use the help. If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace. Heave! and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle. Two. Both. looks around the table. Not enough. smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed. You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell. He's right. We're all on the same side. We're all breathing. Are you all right? Ever been north before? You've never been down south. That's the north. There's not another woman within 100 miles of here. glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND. Davos says he is a strong fighter. She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee. The first time I went north of the wall was with your father. I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice. I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block. I heard. I'm glad he didn't capture you. stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword. Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw. hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands. Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros. But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it. I'm not his son. Who's that? You knew him? I serve the north. The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me. Why? That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants. So what are you fighting for? But we all die. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. Aye. Maybe that's enough. How many people live here? That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way? This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead. This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't. We can destroy them by burning them. And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world. There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here. No. I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. I know! I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father. I did this. I should go. No one is less happy about this than I am. You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here. Who told you that? Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information? So, what now? It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked. If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight. It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message. All right. We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together. It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret. No. Not compared to you. Our father was more of a father. And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory. But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me. It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark. So, why are you still talking to me? I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders. Look at you. You're a man. Where's Arya? Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell. We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here. It's not important. You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North. How did you sneak up on me? I didn't. You still have it. Have you ever used it? Jealous? Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa. Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone. Now you're defending her? You? Yeah. I'm her family too. She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up. What's the matter? What's wrong with them? I don't know how to ride a dragon. What if he doesn't want me to? What do I hold onto? You've completely ruined horses for me. We'd be pretty old. It's cold up here for a southern girl. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.\" Isn't that what he said? I told you we needed allies. I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons. Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance. Do you have any faith in me at all? She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father. Sam? Were you hiding from me? What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already? What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right? Little Sam? Know what? I'm so sorry. We need to end this war. Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me. I wasn't a king. I gave up my crown, Sam. I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore. What are you talking about? My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life. Daenerys is our queen. That's treason. We need every man we can get. I thought we'd lost you. How did you find each other? The Umbers? How long do we have? They're coming. We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel. But there are too many of them. Far too many. Our enemy doesn't tire. Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel. We can't beat them in a straight fight. The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance. We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest. If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does. Let's get some rest. Your Grace. No. Gilly? Little Sam? If you want to join them. To protect them. Now it's just us three. Lyanna Stark. He didn't. He loved her. They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard. My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen. I wish it were. Bran. He saw it. And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant. It's true, Dany. I know it is. The Night King is coming. Dany! Get off! Bran! We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again. Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she? She shouldn't be alone. Aren't you worried for her? We're not much for riddles where I'm from. That's her decision to make. She is our queen. What do you want? I don't want it. I never have. She is my queen. I don't want it, and that's what I told him. I love you. And you will always be my queen. Daybreak at the earliest. Move, move! No! Get back! Get back! Stay! Stay! Stop! Find somewhere to hide. We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back! Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! It's not safe. Let me send some men with you. Grey Worm! It's over. And what are the queen's commands? What are you doing here? Hey, what happened? She's everyone's queen now. Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you. No. Not that I've seen. You didn't. I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now. And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today. You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister. Cersei left her no choice. She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky. Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield. What? I don't know. What's it matter what I'd do? Love is the death of duty. Maester Aemon said it a long time ago. That's her decision. She is the queen. I'm sorry it came to this. My sisters will be loyal to the throne. She doesn't get to choose. I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders. Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned! And Tyrion? Forgive him. You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand. Please, Dany. The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be. How do you know? How do you know it'll be good? I don't. What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good. You are my queen. Now, and always. There's still a Night's Watch? Was it right? What I did? It doesn't feel right. I don't expect we'll ever see each other again. The North is free, thanks to you. Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for. You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black. You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed? You have your Needle? Your Grace. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me. \n"

      "We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything. No. I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home. I don't know. Thank you, ser. Are you from my country? Thank you, Magister. She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki. Do you know the Common Tongue? Is ‘no' the only word that you know? Isn't there anything else? Have you ever seen a dragon? Everywhere? Even in the east? The moon? Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories? How old were you? Nine?! Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy? Will it take three years? Finish a man? Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top. I don't think that this is the Dothraki way. No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face. From whom? Tell them all to stop. Until I command them otherwise. Not a Queen. A Khaleesi. No! Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed. What are you doing? It's a boy. I know. These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages. If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms? But if they did? And you know these men? You sold slaves. Why? And where is she now? Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us. Why did you hit her?! I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper. It's a gift. I had it made for you. Please. Stop - stop it. You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet. I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands. I hit him. I hit the dragon. He is still the true King. No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return. What do you pray for, Ser Jorah? I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home. You're hurt. A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego! Stop him. Viserys, please. He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold. No. He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon. According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world. The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea. Lands, yes... It's not a chair. It's a... A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen. Can't you help me make him understand? My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. And because he had dragons. You don't believe it. My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine. Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine. You honor me, Ser. I hope to repay your kindness someday. Is something wrong? Do as he says. You will drink. I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone. He will not have my son. My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo. He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here. We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me. Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me. Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is. He can't. He can't. l won't let him. l won't leave him. Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo. Stop it! l don't want her hurt. l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon. l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser. And now you must save him. Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic. Do it. Save him. You'll have gold, whatever you want. My death? Kill her and you kill your khal. l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden. Take her and leave. Take her! No one will enter. Bring him back to me. l have to save him. This must be. No, you can't. The baby – is coming. Ser Jorah? My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he? Tell me. How did my son die? What do the women say? Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life. l want to see him now. The khalasar is gone. Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone? This is not life. When will he be as he was? Leave us. l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go. You knew what l was buying and you knew the price. This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent. l spoke for you. l saved you. Your life. Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars. They were not given to me to sell. l must. You don't understand. ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives. Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me. I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life. He said they ate meat. My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything. She was Drogo's first gift to me. I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream? Does it ever end? And you're sure there's no other way? No one will take my dragons. As you are mine. Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast. Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood. You never have. Does it ever end? Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. He is blood of my blood. Who did this? They will like it far less when I'm done with them. Shh. They cannot kill his soul. Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre. And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight. This isn't your horse. Qarth? Will they let us in? What do you know of this place? I thought we were welcome. Horde? My name is Daenerys- You know me, my lord? And what should I call you? The beauty of Quarth is legendary- Qarth. My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored I am not a liar. Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates. What are you doing? You promised to receive me. If you do not let us in, all of us will die. Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first. Dracarys. Dracarys. He'll be able to feed himself from now on. Let him sleep, Doreah. He loves you. Thank you, my friend. The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo. Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy. It sounds wonderful. Please excuse me for a moment. What are they doing? We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it. Not even when we leave. Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more. My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built. That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be. What is the House of the Undying? He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend. And what about what a woman wants? To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne. Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home. I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it. And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you? So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious. What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why? And behind the door? And it can all be mine? All I have to do? That was a romantic proposal. The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country. The usurper is dead. The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other. The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world. And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now. Do not speak to me like I'm a child. What do you want? Tell me. Why? So what would you have me do, as my advisor? And how do I get the ship? I look forward to meeting him. He shouldn't make me wait. I already have a husband. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. My father sat there, before he was murdered. I didn't come here to argue grammar. Not yet. There are many there that support my claim. I left when I was a baby. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? Where are they? Where are my dragons? You are one of the Thirteen. Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world. There is no we, so why would you help me get them back? But it did happen under your roof. I don't care where you've been. You came back. Irri is dead. She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her. We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse. You went to find me a ship. These people\"? And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse. The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive. And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool. There it is. \"Trust me. \" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it. And you are too familiar. Find my dragons. Please, they're my children. I'm begging you. Without me, the dragons will die. How? You have my dragons? But there is no King of Qarth. Astapor? They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children. You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there. Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there. And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember? They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them. Let them try. Is this a riddle? Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl? This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands. That sounds like something you would do. Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me. Dracarys. Come. Nothing. Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson. Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship? Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people. It's too beautiful a day to argue. Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ... They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training. Tell the good master there is no need. You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? How many do you have to sell? Eight thousand dead babies. Once I own them, these men... Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? The warlocks. I owe you my life, Ser. You know this man? To whom? Give me your water. Here, drink. The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents. Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon. They did not. I want to buy them all. Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well. I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop. I have dragons. I'll give you one. One. Done. I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck. You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood? Do you have a name? Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice? You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth. I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.' Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed. Yes, all men must die. But we are not men. Is it done, then? They belong to me? Unsullied! Forward march! Halt! A dragon is not a slave. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue. Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see! Dracarys. Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men? These are the ones? You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks? Remove your helmet What is your name? Grey Worm. From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride. I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea. How many slaves are there in Yunkai? Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city. Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor. You may approach. Sit. Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early. My ship? And what do you ask in return? I have a gift for you as well. Your life. And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy. I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother. My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out. And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? Find out. You know these men? Is he more titan or bastard? How many? Enough to make a difference? It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning. He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl. We have no slaves here. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? We have more, don't we? I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. You're very young to be a captain. Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side. Or you could fight for me. I would pay you as much and more. Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder. A barrel, then. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Ninteen How can anyone speak nineteen languages? Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well? Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride. Athjahaka. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice. What do you want? Let her go. You were sent here to kill me? So why haven't you? What do your captains have to say about that? Why? Over what? You're a strange man. And this is supposed to impress me? Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? Will you fight for me? Swear to me. Where? Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa. You leave tonight. We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city? And Daario Naharis? Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered. People learn to love their chains. No. You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you. What does it mean? It's all right. These people won't hurt me. Fly. Let me pass Ser Barristan. Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm? Gambling? How long have they been at it? What's the prize to winning this stupid contest? That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock. The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for. Have you ever been to Meereen? And? And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried? You were told to ride at the back of the train. All right, what is this matter of strategy? Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding? Would you like to walk without shoes? You are a gambler, aren't you? How many miles are there between here and Meereen? You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her. Are they attacking? What is he doing? I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion? You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you. Which is why you must remain by my side. You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life. Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while. Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching. You sure you don't want a horse? Horses are faster than men. I am Daenerys Stormborn. Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you. Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward! Fire! How are the lessons coming? You'll have to continue later. It's time. Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts? Yes, that was it. I will answer injustice with justice. Who told you to take the Navy? So why did you do it? How many ships? How many men can they carry? Would that be enough to take King's Landing? Please leave me. Not you, Jorah. It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned. You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well. How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me? I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros. I will do what queens do. I will rule. You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend. I thank him for his prayers. Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats, but I will see he is paid their value three times over. Send the next one in. The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself. I thank you. Then it is my honor to receive you. For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him. Your father crucified innocent children. I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that. And what traditions do you speak of? And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial? Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq. How many more? 212? How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded, Don't do that again. These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you. Tell me why you're here. I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing. And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue. You swore me your sword. So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets? Very well. Do what you do best. Take off your clothes. You're here early. You don't approve? You neither approve nor trust. Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother? I trust you. I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai. I have. That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself. And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning? Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it. And now you are helping me show them to freedom. The man who came to me the other day about burying his father. He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one. Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind. No. Tell him you changed my mind. You think he was spying on you? The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see. But you are not Dothraki. Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes. What? When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it? The...the pillar an the stones. Haven't you ever wondered? Why did the usurper pardon you? No, speak to me here. Explain it to me. The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged. Why, then? What was the content of these letters? What information? You told him I was carrying Drogo's child? Yes or no? Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child? That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information. Because you knew it was poisoned. You betrayed me from the first. You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne... and you want me to forgive you? Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can. Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now. You speak it very well. I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you? I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them. My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you. What is it that you want from me? You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair? I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year. Approach my friend. What was her name? How old was she? Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon? in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs. Sons of the Harpy? They've never killed before. I didn't conquer them. Their own people did. Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost? I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces. Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me. Good. Concessions? I'm not a politician. I'm a queen. I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery. The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death? No fighting pits. I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting. How many times must I say no before you understand? Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits… What? Why? You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits? That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets. I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore. Viserion? Rhaegal? Easy. Easy. Easy. It would send a message. Why? Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was. Thank you all for your counsel. About what? The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded. Go on. I'm not my father. I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial. He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right. There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters. The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law-- The law is the law. Take him. You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other. A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death. Leave me. Drogon... Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What? Why? He sang to them? And what did you do? He was good? He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. . And what did you do with the money? How many others are there? Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan? I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me. Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport? I do not recognize this tradition. Barristan the Bold\" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks. I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me. Walk forward. Another step. They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must. But she does not give up on them. Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide. Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps. If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think? You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think? What about \"Valar Morghulis\"? It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live. And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees. Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that. Are you jealous? I do. You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice. So what else can I do? Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't. No. I can't Of course I am a queen. Not a butcher. Sitting through the great games will be bad enough. I think I've seen enough. I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions. Get him out of my sight. Who are you? You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are? If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family? If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word. And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you? I have a very large army and very large dragons. So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned. Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises? Yes, many opportunities. No. Not until forced to do so. So I should kill him? Remove Ser Jorah from the city. So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service? It's probably my safest option. And what would your father do? Is that why you killed him? I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name. I'm terrible? Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible? Which kind is that? I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment. Perhaps it won't come to that. Varys? King Robert's spy master? Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me. But you trust him? The brother who killed my father. Perhaps I will have you killed after all. I'm not going to kill you. No. You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences. How to get what I want. If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool. I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home. The common people. Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground. I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel. Where have you been? I'm not putting my money anywhere. Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you? That is greatness? One day your great city will return to the dirt as well. If need be. If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason. Someone else's reason. Drogon! Valahd.. We have to go home. My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen? How far did you carry me? Drogon, we need to return. My people need me. Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper. Do not touch me I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons I will not lie with you And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east. I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo I know I burnt his body If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads! You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen That is more than most have I need to make water I will never run from Dothraki I needed fresh air The old women stink You must have been very young when your Khal died Too bad he didn't die sooner Mm-hmm They do Would you like to see them one day? No, don't hurt her We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive No We can do more than that And you're going to help me And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads. Don't you want to know what I think? No. I don't want either of those things. I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World. This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains. And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will. lays her hand on a fire pit. You're not going to serve. You're going to die. knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows. I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away. Is there a cure? How long does it take? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal. You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life. Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side. How many days' ride to Meereen? How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros? And who has that many? Nobody yet. I take what is mine. What was I made for? Wait here. Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all. I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea? Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses? Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains? Are you with me? Now and always? The city is on the rise? Good. Shall we begin? I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan. You don't approve? This is entirely different. We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine. My reign has just begun. Dracarys. You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands? And what's wrong with you? Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before? Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king. We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough? So why shouldn't I wait for him? And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands? And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms? And that's all? Reasonable. She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it. You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping. No more. You're not coming with us. You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders. You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage. I don't know. Maybe no one. I can't bring a lover to Westeros. So that's what you want? To be my mistress? I can't. No one tells me to do anything. Don't get angry. A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons. We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we? Farewell, Daario Naharis. No tears. It's not. Yes, you really are. Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it. Well, you have completely failed to console me. It's your counsel I need. Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right. Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen. Shall we begin? I wish I could remember it. I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home. Good. Not so many lions. They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health? People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them. If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already. No. I never properly thanked you for that. You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys? And then you served the man who overthrew him? But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him. So you took it upon yourself to find a better one. Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion? So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki. Who gave the order to kill me? Who hired the assassins? Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen? To keep yourself alive. Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that? Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them. And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive. The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name? You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone. We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king. The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he? What does your Lord expect from me? The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince. No, but I like it better. And you believe this prophecy refers to me? You know him? He sounds like quite a man. Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee. That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect. I am not here to be queen of the ashes. I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing. We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people. Do I have your support? Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone? I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros. Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough. Forgive me -- Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong? No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion? Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee. Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen? My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it. Then why are you here? Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived? And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me? But still, I need your help? Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help. You told me you liked this man. In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child. As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north. The dead? Is that another figure of speech? I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it. We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea. They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will. That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion. You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms. Not yet. And? All of them? Dragonglass? Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies. And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass? And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings? Which wise man said this? Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom? What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that? I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now. You lost two brothers as well? People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know. He is my Hand. We all enjoy what we're good at. You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne. And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne. I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you. You better get to work, Jon Snow. We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it. I'm not talking about sending our ships after him. I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them? What about Casterly Rock? and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard. Soon. They will come back to me. stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking. What happened? Many things? looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down. It's all right. descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch. is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass. When? They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men. stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together. Doing what? Fighting each other? They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive. turns to look at JON. And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons? steps forward closer to JON. I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee. steps even closer to JON until they're face to face. They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride? What is it? That's very good to hear. Isn't it? You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island. Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach. stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion. The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach. Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all. begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water. Enough with the clever plans. turns back and looks at TYRION. I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep. My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them? looks over to JON SNOW. What do you think I should do? I'm at war. I'm losing. begins walking close to JON. looks back out to her dragons flying along the water. Dracarys! commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow. I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities -- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die. Step forward, My Lord. You will not kneel? You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that. turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward. Who are you? I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it. I'm not beheading anyone. looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm. Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die. pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON. Dracarys. They're beautiful, aren't they? They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children. turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance. turns back to JON. No. And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday. You're not sure how you feel about that? turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows. How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons? We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people. So it was a figure of speech? He is my friend. Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend. You look strong. You found a cure? It would be my honor. steps forward and hugs JORAH. and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it. I'm happy for you. You don't look happy. You said you don't have enough men. And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in. I thought that was what we are trying to avoid. And how would you get into King's Landing. Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men. turns to look at JORAH. I haven't given you permission to leave. pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement. We should be better at saying farewell by now. reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS. smiles. But I've grown used to him. nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it. Do you know what I like about you? You're not a hero. walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION. I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing. Jon Snow's not in love with me. My apologies. Yes. That's all. Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word. I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all. A hundred thousand, at least. Just the King I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing. I didn't come all this way to have my Hand I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it. This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else. I can't have children. The witch who murdered my husband. You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different. I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north. And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell. I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together. Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you. Whatever they want. Your sister doesn't like me. She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me- How many today? The dragons are barely eating. They don't like the North. Go on. Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon. Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow. Whatever you can. We could stay a thousand years- No one would find us. So keep your queen warm. Don't be afraid. So you're the man? The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could. I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward. Well, there must be something I could give you. For what crime? From the Citadel? Not Randyll Tarly? I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused. Your brother stood with your father. Of course. When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father. Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor. He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp. Your sister pledged to send her army north. I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me. We\"? Like you knew your sister? Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat. So why have you abandoned your house and family now? What does the Warden of the North say about it? Very well. Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool. Not for the first time. Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can. Have you done something to offend me? Long ago and long forgiven. When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much. He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes. You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position? Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone. I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime. I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors. I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good. I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei. I thought he knew his sister. Ours certainly have been. We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell. And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother. That bothers you. All my life, I've known one goal I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about. Someone taller. I take the Iron Throne. What is it? Your sister? But why aren't you with her? Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt. There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it. Who's that? My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her. That's impossible. Who told you this? He saw it? A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you? If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne. The dead are already here. Dracarys. Go! Jorah! Gendry. That's right, isn't it? You're Robert Baratheon's son. You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered? Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now? Does anyone? I think you should be Lord of Storm's End. No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you. See? You're not the only one who's clever. Someone has betrayed me. Jon Snow. He knows the truth about Jon. Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me. And Varys? You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission. Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain? Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down. No. It doesn't matter now. Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ... sentence you to die. Dracarys. This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession. It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him. What did I say would happen if you told your sister? She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear. Is that all I am to you? Your queen? All right, then. Let it be fear. In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived. They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine? Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness. But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant. Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies. Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time. Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines. It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me. Blood of my blood. You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits. Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms. Torgo Nudho. You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War. Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant! But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world! From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel. Will you break the wheel with me? You freed your brother. You committed treason. Take him. When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet. It was necessary. I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me. He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart? I can't. We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have. And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world. Because I know what is good. And so do you. You do. You do. You've always known. They don't get to choose. Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together. \n"
