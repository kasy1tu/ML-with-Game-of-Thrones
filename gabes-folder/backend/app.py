Joffrey is also unaware that King Robert is not his real father â€“ who, in reality, is Jaime Lannister. After Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey the King against his father's will, and Joffrey becomes a cruel ruler and a Puppet King used by his mother.", "Balon Greyjoy is the Lord of the Iron Islands and the head of House Greyjoy of Pyke.
